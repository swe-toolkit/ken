# A proved, pure `Map k v` over `Ord k` — conformance seed

Format: `../../README.md`. These pin the **Map-container deliverable**
(`docs/program/wp/Map-container.md`, `spec/50-stdlib/52-map.md`; VAL2 #8 /
OQ-A): a **proved, pure, `Ord k`-keyed** associative map shipped as ordinary
**package Ken — out of `trusted_base()`, not a kernel builtin**. Its carrier is
an ordinary inductive (`data Tree k v = Leaf | Node …`), its operations are
kernel-re-checked `view` defs, and **every correctness law is a real kernel
proof, not a postulate** (`52 §1`, `21 §3`). This closes `letter-frequency`'s
gap — `Map` was a bare opaque primitive with **zero operations** — and
**retires** that opaque primitive (net-negative TCB).

**Grounded (content-verified against the landed `52-map.md` off
`wp/Map-container@cf0a1df`, not heading numbers — the
`conformance-oracle-grounding-fallback` discipline):** `52 §3` (bare unbalanced
BST carrier, `data Tree k v = Leaf | Node (Tree k v) k v (Tree k v)`); `52 §4`
(the seven-op API — `empty`/`insert`/`lookup`/`member`/`toList`/`fromList`/
`fold`, **no `delete`**); `52 §5` (the invariant + correctness laws as real
proof terms — `Ordered` preservation, the three core `lookup` laws, the `toList`
ordered law + agreement); `52 §2.1` (key identity via `Ord.antisym → Equal`,
localized to the overwrite law, ADR 0010 canonical-carrier); `52 §9` (AC1–AC5).
Cross-checked against the landed `../classes/seed-lawful-classes.md`
(laws-PROVED ≡ zero-`trusted_base()`-delta; `Ord Bool` the only non-`Axiom`
order-law carrier today, `51 §6`), `../../challenge/C1-deceq-noncanonical` (the
non-canonical-carrier `Bottom` exploit),
`../../challenge/C6-lawful-ord-vs-stub`, and `../../challenge/C2`/`C5` (the
proof-relevant-`Ω` / verified-sort coupling that the deferred permutation law
inherits).

The `toList : … → List (Pair k v)` surface is a positive named-Pair vector. Its
Strict floor form is RED-UNTIL the compiler-origin Pair floor realization and
then uses that always-present transparent-Σ family without a package import. The
existing Map-law evidence remains valid for computation, but current Legacy
availability is not evidence that Strict floor capture has landed.

**Status — the full seven `Map` correctness laws are BUILT + realized on
`main`** — the two Branch-A non-inductive proofs + all **five inductive laws**
(preservation / found-after-insert / locality / agreement / `toList`-ordered),
the capstone `map-verified-laws` complete. Only the permutation law stays
deferred (`tolist-permutation-law-deferred`, a separate proof-relevant C5 gap).
`Map-build` (`a592f0b`, #248) landed the proved package: the `Tree` carrier +
full ops API (`insert`/`lookup`/`member`/`toList`/`fromList`/`fold` + `Set`
ops), the `Ordered`/`allKeys` **definitions**, **one** non-inductive law proof
(`lookup k empty = None`, `map.ken:161`), and the opaque `Map`/`Set` primitive
**retirement** — so the **AC1 / AC2 / AC5** cases + that one shipped Branch-A
**AC3** proof are **realized on `main`** (they drive the real ops through
`ken_interp` and the real `trusted_base_delta` cone walk, not a hand-fed harness
— [[conformance-hand-feeds-the-deliverable]]). The capstone
**`map-verified-laws` (`52 §7d`)** now builds the remainder on the two
**now-landed** enabling capabilities — **Gap B** (dependent-motive recovery over
non-nullary `Tree`/`List`, the non-indexed `elab.rs:535-553` gate,
`dependent-match-nonnullary` `282856c`) + **Gap A** (transport over a stuck
`leq`, the `J` former + `catalog/packages/Core/Logic/`, `surface-transport` `19955d8`).
`Ordered empty = Proved` — the **second** Branch-A proof (Disc 1) — is added +
verified by the elaboration commit `df81689`, so it lands **realized on `main`**
at this merge, sibling of `lookup empty`. **All five inductive laws are now
BUILT + realized on `main`** — law 4 first (`ab40d64`, `dec_48nnx5m14dfsy`),
then laws 1/2/3/5 as the batched capstone (`5719800`, `dec_72bq23xmx63mb`) —
each a real `Decl::Transparent` proof term (`toListOrdered`,
`insertPreservesAllKeys`, `lookupFoundAfterInsert`, `lookupLocality`,
`lookupAssocAgree`), verified by per-law `*_is_a_real_general_proof_term`
acceptance tests, **zero `trusted_base` delta** — a **buildability** boundary,
not soundness ([[buildability-classify-every-capability-axis]]);
**no `Axiom` stubs** (a law that cannot be honestly built re-defers to Steward,
never postulated), **no shipped code leans on a deferred law** (§9 AC3
guardrail). The `(oracle)` tag marks the still-open surface spellings — the
build's Architect-ruled **unbundled explicit-`leq`** encoding realizes the
pinned **concept + value + order**, with `where Ord k` deferred to a Language
surface WP (the T1 over-freezing guard held) — and reference-interpreter
confirmation.

**Supersession — companion reconcile in
`../../surface/collections/seed-collections.md`.** Before OQ-A, `Map`/`Set` were
conformance-pinned as **abstract `DecEq`-keyed content-addressed heap
primitives** (kinds `0x07`/`0x08`, insertion-order-independent canonical
identity, O(1) slot-id equality — `37 §3.3` DRAFT). This WP's `/spec` **flips**
`37 §3.3` to the proved-BST model (`Ord k`-keyed, **extensional** identity via
ordered `toList`, out of `trusted_base()`). The superseded heap-`Map`/`Set`
cases in `seed-collections.md` are reconciled to this model in the **same
branch** (else the corpus self-contradicts the spec on merge — the
internal-consistency gate); see that file's supersession note. There are **not
two `Map`s**. Durable write/read round-trip preserves extensional Map/Set
equality and ordered observations. Internal bytes, hashes, and deduplication
outcomes are not observable under R2; this corpus compares neither byte
equality nor inequality across insertion histories.

## AC1 — net-negative TCB (`Map` is derived Ken, not a primitive)

`52 §9` AC1: (a) the kernel crate is untouched; (b) `trusted_base()` **shrinks**
by exactly the retired `Map`/`Set`, **zero additions**. A proved map *requires*
a transparent inductive carrier (only constructors + an eliminator give the
case-split + redex reduction a proof needs — `52 §1.1`), so "proved"
structurally forces the retirement of the constructor-less opaque primitive.

### stdlib/map/carrier-inductive-ops-defs-not-primitive (soundness)
- spec: `52 §1.1`/`§3`/`§9` (AC1), `16 §1` (`Ω` props), `34 §1` (transparent
  inductive `data`)
- given: the built `Map` package (`catalog/packages/Data/Collections/…`) as admitted into the
  kernel environment.
- expect: `Tree k v` is admitted by **`declare_inductive`** (two constructors
  `Leaf`/`Node`, kernel-rechecked, an induction principle exists); `insert`/
  `lookup`/`member`/`toList`/`fromList`/`fold` are **`declare_def`** `view`s;
  the `Ordered` invariant + the `§5` laws are **`declare_def`** `Ω`-props /
  proof terms. **`declare_primitive` and `declare_postulate` are ABSENT** for
  `Map`/`Tree`/`Set` and every op and law. Assert the admission **kind** of each
  global structurally (grep the real admission call, not the source text).
- why: AC1's derived-not-primitive core and the `52 §1.1` structural premise.
  **`(soundness)`** — a `Map` law reaching the kernel as a `declare_postulate`
  (or the carrier as a `declare_primitive OpaqueType`) would re-grow
  `trusted_base()` and mean the "proof" is postulated. Verify the trust
  **level** by the admission primitive, not the name
  ([[kernel-backed-claim-grep-the-emission-not-the-name]]). (structural
  admission-kind; producer-grepped.)

### stdlib/map/kernel-crate-untouched (soundness)
- spec: `52 §9` AC1(a)
- given: the merged Map-container build diff.
- expect: `git diff origin/main -- crates/ken-kernel/` is **empty** — no new
  kernel rule, former, or `Decl` variant for `Map`/`Tree`/`Set`; the map is
  admitted through the **existing** `declare_inductive`/`declare_def` API. The
  primitive lived in `ken-elaborator/prelude.rs` (not the kernel crate), so the
  kernel is untouched by both its retirement and the map's arrival.
- why: AC1's zero-kernel-delta face — a new kernel feature for `Map` would be an
  over-build (`52` banner). **`(soundness)`** — the TCB shape is a kernel-crate
  fact. Structural (empty diff), not a value. (structural; empty kernel diff.)

### stdlib/map/opaque-primitive-retired-trusted-base-shrinks (soundness)
- spec: `52 §1.1`/`§9` (AC1(b), AC5), `30 §6` (`trusted_base()` item-2 taxonomy)
- given: `trusted_base()` **before** (opaque `Map`/`Set`
  `declare_primitive OpaqueType` present, item-2, like `String`/`Bytes`) and
  **after** the build.
- expect: **the membership flips one way only.** After: the opaque `Map`/`Set`
  primitive entries are **GONE** from `trusted_base()`, and **nothing new is
  added** for the proved map (its carrier/ops/laws are kernel-rechecked, §AC1
  above). Net delta is a **shrink** by exactly the two retired entries — the
  strong direction of zero-TCB. Assert both halves: old entries absent **and**
  zero new entries.
- why: AC1(b)/AC5 — "proved, not trusted" pays out as a **net-negative** trust
  delta ([[abstraction-visibility-feature-soundness-gate]]: zero-delta is
  grounded by the kernel being untouched **and** the retirement being real).
  **`(soundness)`** — a build that adds the proved map **without** removing the
  primitive grows the surface (two `Map`s) and misses AC1's strong direction;
  the removal is only real when the code drops it (AC5), verified structurally
  on the merged `trusted_base()`, not from the spec.
  Red-until-Foundation-retires. (structural trusted_base membership;
  net-negative.)

## AC2 — operations correct end-to-end through the real interpreter

`52 §9` AC2 + `§8`: `insert`/`lookup` round-trips, ordered `toList` iteration,
and the `letter-frequency` shape — **driving real ops**, reading back via real
`lookup`/`toList`, never hand-feeding the result. These are **value-flips**: the
correct op and a broken op land on **different observable values**. `Ord Char`'s
`leq = int_leq` **computes**, so Char-keyed maps evaluate end-to-end (the
`letter-frequency` shape) even though `Char`'s order-*laws* are `Axiom`
(`52 §5.4`); the fully-real proof witness (AC3) keys on `Bool`.

### stdlib/map/insert-lookup-roundtrip-some
- spec: `52 §4.1`/`§5.2` (law 2, found-after-insert), `§8`
- given: `lookup k (insert k v empty)` — a real `insert` into the real `empty`,
  read back by a real `lookup`. Run at `k : Char` (computes) and, for the
  all-the-way-down witness, `k : Bool`.
- expect: **reduces-to `Some v`.** The value threaded in comes back out under
  the *same* key. A broken `insert` (drops the entry) or `lookup` (misreads the
  branch) yields `None` or a wrong `Some v'` — the flip.
- why: AC2's found-after-insert round-trip, the `§5.2` law 2 made executable.
  **Drive the real producer:** construct via a real `insert`, read via a real
  `lookup` — not a hand-built `Node`. (reduces-to value-flip; oracle.)

### stdlib/map/lookup-order-distinct-key-is-none
- spec: `52 §4.1`/`§5.2` (law 1 + locality), `§8`
- given: `lookup k' (insert k v empty)` where `k'` is **order-distinct** from
  `k` (`¬ (leq k k' ∧ leq k' k)`); and `lookup k empty`.
- expect: **reduces-to `None`** in both — the absent key is not found; inserting
  `k` does not fabricate a hit for a distinct `k'` (the `§5.2` locality law's
  runtime face). A bug that returns the last-inserted value for **any** query
  (ignoring the key) yields `Some v` — the flip.
- why: AC2's absent/locality face; the non-degenerate partner of the
  found-after-insert case (a hit-only test is green-vs-green under a "return
  anything inserted" bug). (reduces-to value-flip; oracle.)

### stdlib/map/overwrite-last-writer-wins
- spec: `52 §4.1`/`§5.3` (overwrite/uniqueness — the one `antisym → Equal`
  site), `§2.1`
- given: `lookup k (insert k v2 (insert k v1 empty))` with `v1 ≠ v2`, and
  `toList (insert k v2 (insert k v1 empty))`.
- expect: `lookup` **reduces-to `Some v2`** (last writer wins), and `toList`
  yields a **single** entry `[(k, v2)]` — re-inserting an existing key
  **overwrites in place**, it does not duplicate the node (the map stays a
  genuine partial *function*, `Ordered` preserved). A bug that inserts a second
  `Node` for the same key yields `Some v1` (finds the first) or a two-entry
  `toList` — the flip.
- why: AC2 exercising the **overwrite** path — the single place `§5.3`'s
  `antisym`-identified-keys reasoning bites at runtime. Guards against a
  duplicate-on-reinsert bug that a fresh-key-only round-trip cannot see.
  (reduces-to value-flip; oracle.)

### stdlib/map/tolist-ascending-by-key (the ordered law, load-bearing)
- spec: `52 §4.2`/`§5.3` (the `toList` ordered law), `37 §6` (`isSorted`)
- given: a map built by inserting keys in a **deliberately non-ascending** order
  (e.g. `insert 3 · insert 1 · insert 2` over `Int`/`Char` keys), then `toList`.
- expect: **reduces-to a `List (k × v)` whose keys are strictly ascending** —
  `isSorted (λ a b. leq (fst a) (fst b)) (toList m)` holds regardless of
  insertion order (the in-order BST traversal over an `Ordered` tree). A bug
  that emits in insertion order, or a non-`Ordered` tree, yields a non-ascending
  list — the flip is on the **list order**, not just its element set.
- why: AC2's **load-bearing** ordered-iteration law (`§5.3`) — the property that
  makes `letter-frequency`'s output **deterministic**. Insertion out of order is
  the discriminator: an insertion-order-preserving bug passes a pre-sorted-input
  test (green-vs-green) but fails here. The `k × v` result element is the
  **Σ-pair** (`13 §3`, right-nested Σ with η — the `runState`-result construct,
  **distinct** from inductive `Prod`;
  [[composition-wp-real-producer-may-be-deferred-engine]] carry from
  State-effect); pin the pair as Σ, not `Prod`. **This is the `52 §8` "ordered
  iteration honest by the conformance TEST in-WP" net** — and with law 4's
  `toListOrdered` *proof* now **built + realized on `main`** (`ab40d64`,
  **Gap-B-only**), that output is honest **by proof**, not only by this in-WP
  value test; this value-net remains the standing reduces-to-level check
  regardless. (reduces-to value-flip on list order; realized on `main`; proof
  realized with law 4, `ab40d64`.)

### stdlib/map/letter-frequency-shape (the mandated demo)
- spec: `52 §8`/`§9` (AC2), `§4.1`/`§4.2`/`§4.3`
- given: the `letter-frequency` critical path over a `String`/`List Char` input
  `"banana"` (Char keys): fold the characters, `insert`/`lookup`-updating a
  count per key, then emit via ordered `toList`/`fold`.
- expect: **reduces-to** the ascending-by-key frequency list
  `[('a',3), ('b',1), ('n',2)]` — real `insert`/`lookup` build the counts, real
  ordered `toList` emits them deterministically. A miscount (wrong `insert`/
  `lookup` update) changes a value; a non-ordered emit changes the order — both
  flip the observed list.
- why: AC2's headline end-to-end demonstration — the exact `KNOWN-GAP` this WP
  closes, driven through the **real** interpreter over **computing** `Char` keys
  (`leq = int_leq`, `52 §5.4`). Not hand-fed: the counts come from real op
  sequences, the order from the real ordered traversal. (reduces-to value-flip;
  oracle.)

### stdlib/map/fold-agrees-with-tolist-ascending
- spec: `52 §4.3` (the `fold` order contract)
- given: `fold f z m` and the left fold of `f` over `toList m`, for a concrete
  `f`/`z` sensitive to order (e.g. `f k v acc = append acc [k]`).
- expect: **the two reduce to the same value** — `fold` visits entries in the
  **ascending key order** `toList` fixes (`§4.3` pins the order *contract*, not
  a particular recursion). A `fold` that visits in tree/insertion order
  disagrees with the `toList` fold on an order-sensitive `f` — the flip.
- why: AC2's `fold` order contract; the discriminator is an **order-sensitive**
  `f` (a commutative/associative `f` like `+` would be green-vs-green — order
  invisible). (reduces-to value-flip; oracle.)

### stdlib/map/fromList-last-writer-and-ordered
- spec: `52 §4.2` (`fromList` folds `insert`)
- given: `fromList [(2,'b'), (1,'a'), (2,'c')]` then `toList` of the result.
- expect: **reduces-to `[(1,'a'), (2,'c')]`** — `fromList` folds `insert` over
  the list, so it is `Ordered` (ascending) **and** last-writer-wins on the
  duplicate key `2` (`'c'` over `'b'`). A bug preserving list order, or keeping
  the first writer, flips the output.
- why: AC2's `fromList`/`toList` round-trip — ties construction-from-a-list to
  the ordered invariant + overwrite semantics in one value. (reduces-to
  value-flip; oracle.)

### stdlib/map/set-is-map-unit
- spec: `52 §4.4` (`Set a := Map a Unit`)
- given: `member a (insert a (insert b empty))` and `toList` of a `Set`
  (key-projection), over `Ord a` keys, with `a ≠ b`.
- expect: `member` **reduces-to `True`** for an inserted element and `False` for
  an absent one; `toList` yields the elements in **ascending** order. `Set`'s
  behavior is exactly the map's at `v := Unit` (the value carries no
  information). This is what retires the opaque `Set` primitive alongside `Map`.
- why: AC2 for `Set` as the `v := Unit` specialization — no separate mechanism,
  the map's laws project (`§4.4`). The `member` accept/reject is the
  non-degenerate pair. (reduces-to value-flip; oracle.)

---

## AC3 — proved, not stubbed (the load-bearing discriminator)

`52 §9` AC3 + `§5.4`: the `§5` invariant + correctness laws are **real proof
terms**; a discriminating test **fails against a stub/`Axiom` map-proof, for the
right reason** — the swapped-to-`Axiom` proof must be **exercised** by a real
kernel/elaborator obligation (the `trusted_base_delta` cone walk, a downstream
consumer), **not** merely detected as textually absent (Architect's sharpening).

**Why this is NOT a value-flip (the X1 discipline, stated honestly).** The map's
*operations* compute the same value whether the *laws* are proved or postulated:
`lookup k (insert k v m)` reduces to `Some v` by the `insert`/`lookup` **defs**,
independent of whether the found-after-insert **law** carries a real proof or an
`Axiom`. So every AC2 round-trip above is **green-vs-green** for proved-ness —
it cannot witness it. "Proved" is observable only as a **structural fact**: the
map's law terms add **zero** to `trusted_base()`
([[soundness-AC-static-vs-runtime-face]] — this is the static/structural face;
there is no runtime face, the property is compile-time by construction). The
cases below assert that structural fact via the **real** delta-accounting
producer, and flag exactly what would make it a value-flip (a consumer whose
*type-checking* forces a reduction `Axiom` short-circuits — deferred, §7c
territory).

### stdlib/map/laws-real-proofs-zero-new-delta (soundness)
- spec: `52 §5`/`§5.4`/`§9` (AC3), `../classes/seed-lawful-classes.md`
  (`law-fields-real-proofs-not-postulates`), `30 §6`
- given: the shipped Branch-A proof `lookup k empty = None` (`map.ken:161`,
  realized on `main` `a592f0b`) — plus its Branch-A sibling
  `Ordered empty = Proved`, added + verified by spec-author's elaboration `df81689`
  and so **co-realized at this merge** (Disc 1 resolved by option (a)), and the
  `Ordered`/`allKeys` **definitions**. Each closes **without induction**
  (`lookup … Leaf ⇝ None` by refl; `Ordered Leaf ⇝ ⊤` by `tt`), citing **no**
  dictionary law, so it is real regardless of the key instance. (This
  delta-net's mechanism is the cone walk itself; the **five inductive** capstone
  laws carry the **same** zero-delta property, pinned by
  `map-verified-laws-deferred`, `52 §5.4`/`§9`.)
- expect: the map package's **incremental** `trusted_base_delta` over the
  `Ord Bool` dictionary is **∅** (zero-NEW-delta): the proofs discharge by
  case-split on the tree constructor + redex reduction, closing with
  `refl`/`tt`/`absurd`, citing the dictionary's `refl`/`antisym`/`trans`/`total`
  only as **hypotheses** (the trivial Branch-A pair postulates **nothing**, not
  even a dictionary law). **The flip:** replace the shipped Branch-A proof
  `lookup k empty = None` (and its now-co-realized sibling `Ordered empty`) with
  `Axiom` (a
  `declare_postulate`) and the elaborator's `collect_consts_in_tb` cone walk
  **counts** it → the incremental delta is **non-empty** → **rejected as
  unlawful** (the exact `law-fields-real-proofs-not-postulates` mechanism, one
  layer up from `Ord` to `Map`). Real proof: empty delta, accepts. Stub:
  non-empty delta, rejects. The five **inductive** laws carry the identical
  present + proven + zero-delta pin — `map-verified-laws-deferred`.
- why: AC3's headline, at the **map-proof level**
  ([[lawful-class-instances-must-carry-law-proofs]]). **Exercised, not textual**
  — the cone walk traverses the **actual** proof term (including `absurd`
  subterms, per `absurd-subterm-postulate-counted-in-delta`), so it catches a
  postulate the build hid anywhere, not a source grep. **Zero-NEW-delta, not
  zero-delta** ([[deceq-on-noncanonical-carrier-inhabits-bottom]] sibling; the
  `Ord Int`/ `Ord Char` order-laws being `Axiom` is a **separate, honest**
  primitive-carrier audited delta — the map's OWN proof must add zero
  *further*). **`(soundness)`** — a stubbed map-law reads `proved`-by-default
  and the kernel does not catch it; the delta net is the sole backstop
  ([[untrusted-layer-backstop-hole-for-omissions]]). Verdict-independent
  structural (delta membership). (soundness; structural delta-flip; oracle.)

### stdlib/map/no-shipped-code-leans-on-a-deferred-law (soundness)
- spec: `52 §9` AC3 guardrail (hard build condition), `52 §5.4`/`§7d`
- given: the shipped ops as admitted on `main` (`a592f0b`, `map.ken`):
  `insert : … → Tree k v`, `lookup : … → Option v`,
  `toList : … → List (Pair k v)`, `member`/`fold`/`Set` ops — their **result
  types**.
- expect: **no shipped op's type mentions `Ordered` or any deferred law** —
  every op returns a **plain** value (`Tree`/`Option`/`List`/`Bool`), **not** an
  `Ordered`-indexed / proof-carrying type. So deferring the five inductive laws
  (`52 §7d`) breaks **no** shipped code (the map WORKS — ops compute — without
  the correctness proofs). Structural: grep the op signatures — none is
  `Ordered`-indexed. **The flip:** a build that made `insert` return
  `Ordered m ⇒ Ordered (insert …)` (proof-carrying) would **need** the deferred
  preservation proof → would `Axiom`-stub it (caught by the zero-`Axiom` net,
  `laws-real-proofs-zero-new-delta`) or fail to elaborate. Verified green on
  `a592f0b`.
- why: the guardrail that makes "defer the five laws, ship the ops" **sound** —
  nothing depends on the deferred proofs, so their absence is a completeness
  gap, never a soundness one ([[untrusted-layer-backstop-hole-for-omissions]]).
  **`(soundness)`.** The **consumer-delta-flip variant** (a client leaning on a
  real correctness law like found-after-insert, the `Axiom` propagating into the
  client's trust cone) is **now realized as
  `consumer-leans-on-correctness-law-delta-flip`** (red-until-built with the
  capstone) — the genuine proved-vs-`Axiom` verdict-flip. This
  signature-level guardrail remains the **static** net (no shipped op is
  `Ordered`-indexed, so deferring/building the laws breaks no shipped code
  either way). (soundness; structural op-signature; realized on `main`.)

### stdlib/map/consumer-leans-on-correctness-law-delta-flip (soundness)
- spec: `52 §9` AC3 guardrail, `§5.2` (found-after-insert), `§5.3` (agreement),
  `53 §2`/`§3` (transport)
- given: red-until-built — the consumer *fixture* is unauthored (the
  correctness laws it leans on are now all built); a small **consumer** term
  `c` (a
  conformance fixture, not a shipped op) that **type-checks by leaning on a real
  correctness law** over an **abstract** map `m`: e.g. it transports a value
  along `foundAfterInsert k v m : Eq (Option v) (lookup k (insert k v m))
  (Some v)` (via `J`/`subst`), so `c`'s well-typedness **requires** that law's
  proof. Over an *abstract* `m`, `lookup k (insert k v m)` is **stuck** — only
  the law, not computation, closes the goal; that is what makes the consumer the
  discriminator.
- expect: **a verdict-flip on the package-load, keyed on the consumer's trust
  cone.** With the **real** `foundAfterInsert` (zero-delta), `c`'s incremental
  `trusted_base_delta` is **∅** → package + consumer load, **accepted**. Swap
  that law for `Axiom` (`declare_postulate`) and `c`, by depending on it,
  **pulls the `Axiom` into its own cone** → `c`'s `trusted_base_delta` is
  **non-empty** → the load is **rejected** by the same `collect_consts_in_tb`
  cone walk — the `laws-real-proofs-zero-new-delta` mechanism, now exercised
  **transitively through a consumer**, not just at the law's own declaration.
  Real proof: accept. `Axiom`: reject. Opposite verdicts.
- why: the **genuine proved-vs-`Axiom` discriminator the AC2 behavioral cases
  cannot deliver** — the ops **compute the same value** whether the correctness
  laws are proved or stubbed, so proved-ness is **not observable in the result
  value**. **Honest note — this is a *structural* delta/verdict-flip, NOT a
  value-flip on the transported result:** propositional equality is
  proof-irrelevant, so transport along a *real* vs an *`Axiom`* proof yields the
  **same** value; the flip lives in the **trust cone** (delta membership →
  accept-vs-reject), which the value cannot witness (the X1 structural-output
  discipline: assert the trace/cone, never a vacuous value). It **un-defers with
  `map-verified-laws`**: before a real correctness law existed no consumer could
  lean on one, so `no-shipped-code-leans-on-a-deferred-law` was the only net;
  now the consumer makes the `Axiom` propagation **testable** end-to-end.
  **`(soundness)`** — verdict-independent structural (cone membership).
  (soundness; structural cone-delta verdict-flip; red-until-built.)

### stdlib/map/ordered-invariant-derived-not-opaque (soundness)
- spec: `52 §5.1`/`§9`, `37 §6` (`isSorted`-style `Ω` recursion), `16 §1.3`
- given: the `Ordered` invariant and its helper `allKeys` as admitted on `main`
  (`a592f0b`, `map.ken` — `view` defs, constant `Prop` motive → `infer_match`).
- expect: `Ordered`/`allKeys` are **`declare_def` `Ω`-valued structural
  recursions** the prover **unfolds** (built from the
  `IsTrue b := Equal Bool b True` bridge + the derived `Ω`-conjunction `∧`),
  **not** postulates. An **opaque** invariant (a `declare_postulate`/primitive
  `Ordered`) makes the preservation obligation **undischargeable or circular**
  (`52 §5.1`, the `37 §6` surface-minimality discipline). Assert
  `Ordered ∉ trusted_base()` and that it **reduces** on a concrete tree.
- why: the invariant-transparency half of "proved, not stubbed" — a proof by
  case-split needs an invariant that **unfolds** (`52 §5.1`). **`(soundness)`**
  — an opaque invariant hides the very obligation the proof must discharge.
  Structural (admission-kind + reduces), not a value. (soundness; structural;
  oracle.)

## AC — canonical-carrier constraint (§2.1, the `antisym → Equal` localization)

`52 §2.1` + ADR 0010: the overwrite law's `Ord.antisym : … → Equal k x y` is a
theorem **only over a canonical carrier** (exactly one representation per
semantic key). The map **inherits** this obligation on its key type; it does not
create a new one. This is the `../../challenge/C1-deceq-noncanonical` story
applied to the map's one `Equal`-promotion site.

### stdlib/map/antisym-equal-sound-over-canonical-key
- spec: `52 §2.1`/`§5.3`, `ADR 0010`
- given: the overwrite/uniqueness proof (`§5.3`) over a **canonical** key
  carrier — `Int`/`Char`/`Bool` (one representation per value).
- expect: **accepts** — `leq k k' ∧ leq k' k ⇒ Equal k k'` is sound (the induced
  order-equality agrees with definitional equality on a canonical carrier), so
  the overwrite proof goes through and the map is a lawful partial function.
- why: the sound arm of `§2.1`'s canonical-carrier pair. **Deferred
  (buildability):** the overwrite proof (`§5.3`) is Branch-B (**Gap A + Gap B**,
  `52 §7d`) — un-defers with `map-verified-laws`. The **canonicity** property
  pinned here (sound over `Int`/`Char`/`Bool`) is the **orthogonal** axis
  (`52 §2.1` note) — a design property, assertable now; its *proof* awaits the
  build. (accepts; canonicity-axis; oracle; law deferred.)

### stdlib/map/noncanonical-key-not-a-lawful-map-key (soundness)
- spec: `52 §2.1`, `ADR 0010`, `../../challenge/C1-deceq-noncanonical`,
  `../classes/seed-lawful-classes.md` (`Num`/`DecEq Decimal` re-defer)
- given: a **non-canonical** key carrier — `Decimal = MkDecimalPair coeff exp`,
  where `10×10⁻¹` and `1×10⁰` are **distinct pairs** denoting `1` — used to key
  a `Map`, with a **postulated** `antisym` over it.
- expect: **rejects / not a lawful `Map` key.** A postulated `antisym` there
  proves `Equal Decimal (10,-1) (1,0)` between distinct representatives;
  `MkDecimalPair`-injectivity refutes it → **inhabits `Bottom`** (the
  `DecEq Decimal` trap, ADR 0010). Such a type is **not** a lawful `Ord` key,
  therefore **not** a lawful `Map` key — the overwrite law is unavailable over
  it. The correct disposition is to **re-defer** (canonicalize the carrier or a
  setoid/quotient `Eq`), exactly as `Num`/`DecEq Decimal` are re-deferred in the
  lawful-classes lane.
- why: the unsound arm — the **non-degenerate pair** with the canonical case,
  keyed on the **structural** discriminator **canonicity per carrier** (not
  per-type: `Char` is canonical though its order-*laws* are `Axiom`; `Decimal`
  is non-canonical regardless — the two orthogonal ADR 0010 axes, `52 §5.4`).
  **`(soundness)`** — accepting a `Decimal`-keyed map with postulated `antisym`
  inhabits `Bottom` ([[deceq-on-noncanonical-carrier-inhabits-bottom]]). A
  single canonical-accept case is green-vs-green under a build that never checks
  canonicity. **The verdict (`Decimal` is not a lawful `Map` key) is a key-type
  property, assertable independent of the deferred overwrite proof** — it's the
  ADR 0010 / C1 story about whether `Decimal` is a lawful `Ord` key; when the
  overwrite law lands (`map-verified-laws`, `52 §7d`) it is the site the
  constraint bites. (soundness; verdict-flip pair on canonicity; oracle.)

### stdlib/map/lookup-laws-need-no-equal-promotion
- spec: `52 §2.1` (blast-radius localization), `§5.2`
- given: the three core `lookup` laws (`§5.2`, law 1 / found-after-insert /
  locality) as proof terms.
- expect: they discharge using **`refl`** (`IsTrue (leq k k)`) and
  **`total`**/`leq`-determinism **only** — **no `antisym → Equal` step**. The
  found-after-insert value is `v` whichever key label the node carries; locality
  uses order-distinctness. So the three `lookup` laws hold over the **induced
  order alone**, independent of carrier canonicity — only the **overwrite** law
  (`§5.3`) needs the canonical carrier.
- why: pins the `§2.1` **localization** — confining the canonical-carrier
  dependency to the single overwrite site keeps it auditable. Guards against a
  build (or a conformance over-claim) that spreads the `Equal`-promotion into
  the `lookup` laws, over-coupling them to canonicity. **Mechanism-consistency
  check** (my V2 carry): the `lookup` laws and the overwrite law must agree on
  *which* order-faculty each uses (`refl`/`total` vs `antisym → Equal`).
  **Deferred (buildability):** found-after-insert + locality are Branch-B (**Gap
  A + Gap B**, `52 §7d`); this case pins the **canonicity** axis (they need no
  `Equal`-promotion — the orthogonal axis, `52 §2.1`), which un-defers with
  `map-verified-laws`. (structural proof-shape; canonicity-axis; oracle; law
  deferred.)

## AC4 — no regression

### stdlib/map/workspace-green-siblings-unchanged
- spec: `52 §9` AC4
- given: the workspace after the Map-container build.
- expect: `cargo test --workspace` **green**; the lawful `Ord`/`DecEq` instances
  and the rest of `catalog/packages/` (`List`/`Nat`) behave **identically** pre/post —
  the map is an additive package plus a primitive **removal** that nothing else
  depended on for *operations* (there were none). Any consumer that only *named*
  `Map` (never built/queried it) still elaborates.
- why: AC4's no-regression face; the retirement removes an operation-less
  primitive, so no working program loses behavior. (property; workspace-green.)

---

## Deferred (§7) — named follow-ons, never silent gaps (AC3)

`52 §7` defers three items, each a **named** follow-on. Conformance pins the
**boundary** (do not test the deferred behavior; do not let its absence read as
coverage), per the absurd-nothing-silently-dropped discipline.

### stdlib/map/no-delete-this-wp
- spec: `52 §4`/`§7b`
- given: the `§4` API surface.
- expect: **`delete` is absent** — operation *and* proof deferred **together**
  (not an unproved op under the "proved map" banner). A conformance suite for
  this WP **must not** assert a `delete` behavior; the absence is the **named**
  `§7b` follow-on, not a gap. `letter-frequency`'s critical path (insert +
  lookup + ordered iteration) does not need it.
- why: pins the API boundary honestly — guards against a test that expects
  `delete` (would false-fail a faithful build) **and** against the absence
  reading as silent incompleteness. (boundary; named deferral.)

### stdlib/map/balance-deferred-perf-not-correctness
- spec: `52 §3`/`§6`/`§7a`
- given: the unbalanced BST carrier.
- expect: operations are **O(log n) balanced / O(n) worst-case** on this
  **unbalanced** tree — stated honestly. Balance is a **perf property, separable
  from correctness**: the `§5` laws hold over the unbalanced tree, so **no
  conformance case asserts a complexity bound or balance metadata**. The
  balancing follow-on (`§7a`) is a **superseding representation** that re-proves
  the same law set — the signature-level API (`§4`) is stable across it. HAMT is
  explicitly out of scope (a parked later fast-map).
- why: pins the correctness/perf split — the correctness corpus is
  representation-independent, so it does **not** regress when balance lands.
  Guards against baking a complexity assertion into a black-box behavioral case.
  (boundary; named deferral.)

### stdlib/map/map-verified-laws-deferred (soundness)
- spec: `52 §7d` (`map-verified-laws`), `§5.1`/`§5.2`/`§5.3`,
  `elab.rs:535-553` (the non-indexed dependent-match gate,
  `ind.indices.is_empty()`), `34 §3.2` (dependent-motive recovery)
- given: the **five inductive** `§5` law proofs — preservation, found-after-
  insert, locality, agreement, `toList`-ordered — are **ALL BUILT + realized on
  `main`**. Law 4 landed first (`ab40d64`); laws **1/2/3/5** landed as the
  **batched capstone gate** (`5719800`, `dec_72bq23xmx63mb` — the final CV
  touch), all real proof terms (`insertPreservesAllKeys`,
  `lookupFoundAfterInsert`, `lookupLocality`, `lookupAssocAgree`). Enabling
  capabilities: Gap A (`19955d8`), Gap B (`282856c`), the conv-completeness
  fixes (`9cf468a`), **and Res-1's `trans`/`cong` single-combined-`J`
  composition** that **dissolved Wall 1** — laws 1/2/3/5 avoided the nested-`J`
  entirely, so **no `infer_j` elaborator fix was needed**; the `Wall 1` /
  `eq_at_inductive` obstructions this case earlier named were **sidestepped by
  proof-structuring, not fixed**. **Law 5 uses the corrected statement**
  (`Ordered m -> Distinct leq m -> ...`, `map-law5-restate` `e25db43`) and its
  own proof is **antisym-free / carrier-general** (`transLeq`/`refl`, no
  `antisym`); only the separate `insert`/`fromList` ⟹ `Distinct` **discharge
  lemma** (Foundation's named follow-on, **not in this batch**, not part of law
  5's statement) carries ADR-0010's canonical-carrier obligation.
- expect: each is PRESENT as a real, kernel-checked **`Decl::Transparent`**
  proof term in `map.ken` (whole-declaration `check`, `check.rs:984`, the true
  soundness net) — **not** `Axiom`-stubbed — with **zero `trusted_base` delta**
  (reduces through the existing `Term::J`/`Term::Cast` + dependent-match
  `Term::Elim`; grep: zero `Axiom`/`declare_postulate` for any map law, zero new
  `declare_primitive`, zero `crates/ken-kernel/` touched). **All five
  are VERIFIED on `main`** as real `Decl::Transparent` proof terms by per-law
  acceptance tests — law 4 `tolistordered_law4_...`, law 1
  `preservesordered_law1_...`, law 2 `lookupfoundafterinsert_law2_...`, law 3
  `lookuplocality_law3_...`, law 5 `lookupassocagree_law5_...` — each asserting
  the whole proof chain is `Decl::Transparent`, the trust-*level* assertion, not
  a name check (a weakened/postulated body would not elaborate; the law-4
  whole-body `declare_def` recheck used to OOM at ~12 GB pre-`9cf468a`). The
  Unit-2 build added one prelude helper — **`Not : Ω → Ω := \A. A → Bottom`**
  (for `NoDup`'s per-entry negation, since the surface has no
  expression-position `->`) — an ordinary `declare_def` built like `And`/`Or`,
  **zero `trusted_base` delta**.
  **Per-law capability (as built):** `toList`-ordered = Gap B only
  (comparison-free convoy induction); preservation / found-after-insert /
  locality / agreement = Gap A + Gap B, discharged by the convoy induction +
  **Res-1's `trans`/`cong` single-combined-`J`** transport (which avoids the
  nested-`J`, so no `infer_j` fix was needed).
  **Law 5 (agreement) — corrected statement, antisym-free.** Its statement is
  `Ordered m -> Distinct leq m -> lookup key m = assoc key (toList m)`, with
  `Distinct leq m := NoDup leq (toList m)` (Ω-valued, comparison-free); **false
  without `Distinct`** — `Ordered`'s weak bounds admit
  the dup-key tree `Node (Node Leaf k v1 Leaf) k v2 Leaf` where `lookup` and
  `assoc ∘ toList` disagree. The **built proof is antisym-free / carrier-
  general** — the matched-node value agreement is `refl` given `Distinct` (uses
  `transLeq` only; the amended restate `e25db43` dropped `antisym` from law 5's
  dict list), so **law 5 does NOT inherit ADR-0010's canonical-carrier
  obligation**; that attaches **only** to the separate `insert`/`fromList` ⟹
  `Distinct` **discharge lemma** (Foundation's named follow-on, not in this
  batch). `Distinct` is **non-vacuous** — `NoDup Nil = ⊤`, so empty / singleton
  / distinct-key maps satisfy it (a real map discharges the precondition) and it
  excludes the dup counterexample; an always-false `Unique` nothing satisfies
  would be the green-vs-green failure — which this is not. **The flip:**
  stubbing any law with `Axiom` (to fake completeness)
  grows the incremental `trusted_base_delta` (caught by
  `laws-real-proofs-zero-new-delta`'s cone walk) → **rejected**; the real
  zero-delta proof → **accepted**. `toList`-ordered's realized proof also
  un-defers the `tolist-ascending-by-key` value-net (now honest **by proof**,
  `52 §5.3`).
- why: the capstone that raises the honest ceiling from the Branch-A pair to the
  **full seven — all realized on `main`**, **on buildability, never soundness**
  ([[buildability-classify-every-capability-axis]]). **`(soundness)`** —
  [[untrusted-layer-backstop-hole-for-omissions]]: a law faked by `Axiom` reads
  `proved`-by-default and the kernel does not catch the *omission*; the
  `trusted_base`-delta cone walk is the sole backstop, so the presence-pin
  asserts **present + real + zero-delta**, verdict-independent structural (delta
  membership). The permutation law **stays deferred**
  (`tolist-permutation-law-deferred`, proof-relevant C5 gap — do not conflate).
  (soundness; structural present-proven zero-delta; **all seven laws realized
  on `main`** — Branch-A pair + laws 1/2/3/4/5; only permutation deferred.)

### stdlib/map/tolist-permutation-law-deferred
- spec: `52 §5.3`/`§7c`, `../../challenge/C2-proof-relevant-omega`,
  `../../challenge/C5-verified-sort`, `37 §6`
- given: the `toList` multiset/permutation law ("`toList` lists exactly the
  inserted entries, once each").
- expect: it is **deferred** — **proof-relevant** (distinct interleavings are
  distinct derivations), so it **cannot** be `data Perm : Ω` directly
  ([[proof-relevant-inductive-cannot-be-declared-at-omega]]); it needs
  `‖Perm_rel‖` or a count-equality form (`37 §6`, the C2 universe), **and**
  `Perm` discharge is the known **C5** prover gap. The **ordered** `toList` law
  (`§5.3`, `stdlib/map/tolist-ascending-by-key`) is its **naturally-`Ω`
  substitute that ships now** and delivers `letter-frequency`'s determinism
  **without** touching permutation. No conformance case asserts the permutation
  law for this WP.
- why: pins the `§7c` deferral to the **right universe** — a permutation law
  authored as a proof-relevant `Ω` inductive would be a consistency finding (the
  C2 boundary). The ordered law is the checkable substitute. Couples C2 (the
  universe) + C5 (the prover gap). (boundary; named deferral; universe-pinned.)

  `consumer-leans-on-correctness-law-delta-flip` (the consumer verdict-flip; its

  only `Map` correctness law still deferred** (proof-relevant, needs the C2
  universe / C5 prover — a *different* lane than the inductive laws; do not
  conflate). Foundation's `insert`/`fromList` ⟹ `Distinct` discharge lemma
  (law 5's usability on arbitrary built maps) is a separate named follow-on, not
  a law.
- **AC5 (build-lane retirement real):** the Foundation-owned `prelude.rs`
  primitive removal + `es2_acceptance.rs` "Map/Set are primitives" **flip** is
  pinned structurally by `opaque-primitive-retired-trusted-base-shrinks`
  (verified on the merged `trusted_base()`, not the spec) — the retirement is
  only real when the code drops it.
