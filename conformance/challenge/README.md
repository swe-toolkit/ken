# Ken challenge suite — the distinctive-depth conformance instrument

> ✅ **FIRST RUN COMPLETE — 2026-07-04 (operator present).** This is a prepared

## What this is (and is not)

VAL2 (the Rosetta pangram, 10 PASS / 6 KNOWN-GAP) validated the surface
**breadth** — output, loops, recursion, strings, ADTs+`match`, higher-order
functions, effects. It deliberately did **not** reach the **depth** of Ken's
*distinctive* value. This suite is the **blind-spot instrument** for that depth:
eight exercises on the axes VAL2's breadth pangram didn't touch, chosen so a
surprising result is **unambiguous** rather than green-vs-green.

It does **not** re-probe VAL2's five documented capability gaps (`Map`, `[FS]`,
`[State]`, mutual-recursion, ≥2-recursive-field-`match`). It stresses the
**adjacent depth** and the axes VAL2 skipped entirely.

## Post-run results (2026-07-04, first run + attribution drills)

Per-exercise actual against the predicted expected-behavior. **No kernel
soundness hole surfaced** (no should-REJECT that inhabits `Bottom` slipped
through — the load-bearing negative).

| # | Actual | vs predicted |
|---|---|---|
| **C1** `deceq-noncanonical` | sound `DecEq Char` **PASS**; unsound `DecEq Decimal` **instance ADMITTED** (false `sound = Axiom` accepted) | as predicted — the machinery **guards deception, not falsehood** (`§51 §5`); canonical-carrier soundness is a *user* obligation, not machine-checked. Not a kernel hole (honest `Axiom`). The Bottom-*exploit* tail is blocked by a surface-expressibility wall (explicit `Refl A x` / injectivity projection). Run with `lawful_classes.ken` prepended. |
| **C2** `proof-relevant-omega` | sound `‖Perm‖`/count **PASS**; unsound `data Perm : Ω` **REJECT — parser gap** (Ω-data ctor doesn't parse), not the Ω-PI sort gate | sound ✓; unsound rejects *coincidentally* (residual #3) |
| **C3** `codata-totality` | sound fuel-unfold **PASS** *(after fixing an arm typo — missing `Some`'s type arg; capability was always present)*; unsound `codata` **REJECT** (`codata` not a keyword) | both ✓ (right reasons) |
| **C4** `indexed-vec-head` | **KNOWN-GAP at the *declaration* step** — `data Vec a : Nat → Type` doesn't parse (residual #1) | ✓✓ confirms the flagged refinement (decl-step, earlier than head-absurdity) |
| **C5** `verified-sort` | sound **PASS**; unsound `const Nil` **ELABORATES** (not rejected at elab) | **SPECIFIED, not a gap** — obligations are emit-at-elaboration (V1) / discharge-later (V3); elaboration never rejects on an undischarged obligation (`21 §5`, `22-obligations.md`). The bogus sort is caught at the *verify* stage, not elab. |
| **C6** `lawful-ord-vs-stub` | law-proved `Ord` **PASS**; `Axiom`-stub `Ord` **also ELABORATES** (admitted) | as predicted — the "a provable law must not be postulated" enforcement is a **documented known-gap** (deferred lawful-classes work). Run with `lawful_classes.ken` prepended. |
| **C7** `quotient-respect` | neither arm produces a `Quot` term: `/` is integer division, not quotient syntax (residual #2) | legacy sketches also omit checked `e` and do not test `respect` |
| **C8** `funext-definitional` | sound (convertible-pointwise) **PASS**; unsound (differ) **REJECT** | funext **IS** surface-reachable (`eq_at_pi` reduces function-`Equal`) — corrected from the first pass. Reachable for *convertible*-pointwise fns; the *non-convertible* case (needs a case-split) is residual #4. |

### Known-frontier residuals (documented, NOT open WPs)

Each: **kernel-capability present, surface can't reach it.** These are the real
frontier-map — logged here, not opened as work, per the operator (Option A).

1. **Indexed families** — `data _ : Nat → Type` (+ index-refining `match`) does
   not parse (`ParseError "expected Eq, found LParen"`). Kernel has indexed
   families; the surface grammar + `data.rs` (hardcodes `indices: vec![]`) do
   not. *(C4.)*
2. **Quotients** — the frontend has no quotient production; `/` is built-in
   integer division, not `A / R / e`. Quotient class and eliminator forms are
   not surface-reachable. Kernel has checked `Term::Quot`/`QuotClass`/`QuotElim`
   (K2). *(C7.)*
3. **Ω-data constructors** — `data P : Ω where … : … P (…)` does not parse
   (`ParseError`). The Ω proof-irrelevance *sort* gate is never reached — a
   parser gap masks it. *(C2-unsound.)*
4. **Dependent-`match`-into-`Equal`/Ω goal doesn't refine** *(NEW — distinct
   from the parser gaps; an elaboration / motive-refinement **completeness**
   gap, not grammar)*. A dependent `match x` whose goal is `Equal`/Ω-typed does
   not refine the scrutinee in the goal — even `(x:Bool) → Equal Bool x x =
   match x { True => Refl ; False => Refl }` rejects (`Refl expects an Eq-shaped
   goal`), while `\x. Refl` (no match) proves it. This blocks a case-split proof
   of a pointwise-equal-but-*non-convertible* function equality — the residual
   of C8's OTT funext face. *(C8.)*

## The two flavors (read this first — it calibrates every result)

Each exercise is a **discriminating pair**: a *sound* arm that should behave one
way and an *unsound/stub* arm that must behave the opposite way. That is what
keeps a surprising result from being green-vs-green.

- **Flavor A — soundness-boundary probes.** The **correct** behavior is
  **REJECT**. These construct a term the kernel/elaborator *should* refuse
  because accepting it inhabits `Bottom`, breaks consistency, or breaks
  totality. **If the unsound arm is ACCEPTED, that is a genuine hole** — the
  highest-value result, and the reason the operator wants to be present. (C1,
  C2, C3.)
- **Flavor B — capability-depth probes.** The **correct** behavior is
  **PASS** (if the capability is landed) or a **documented known-gap** (if it is
  not yet built). These reach past VAL2's surface for dependent elimination,
  verified programs, and law-carrying instances. A known-gap here is a valid
  prepared result, not a failure. (C4, C5, C6, C7, C8.)

## Expected-behavior legend

Every exercise's `README.md` states, per arm, exactly one of:

- **should-REJECT (reason)** — the elaborator/kernel must refuse it; the reason
  names the exact gate (an unprovable obligation, an Ω sort error, an absent
  former). Acceptance = a hole.
- **should-PASS** — it must elaborate and (where relevant) reduce to the stated
  value.
- **known-gap (reason)** — the capability is not yet landed; the reason names
  the deferred mechanism and its spec/ticket anchor. A clean, expected gap.

## The suite

Format per entry — **`slug` · axis · flavor** — sound arm → / unsound arm →.

- **C1 · `deceq-noncanonical` · lawful classes / canonical carrier · A** —
  `DecEq Char` PASS / `DecEq Decimal` + Bottom-exploit **REJECT**.
- **C2 · `proof-relevant-omega` · Ω / strict-prop boundary · A** —
  `‖Perm‖` / count-eq PASS / `data Perm : Ω` (4-ctor) **REJECT**.
- **C3 · `codata-totality` · coinduction under totality · A** — fuel-bounded
  `unfoldUpTo` PASS / `codata`/`cofix` stream **REJECT**.
- **C4 · `indexed-vec-head` · dependent / indexed families · B** — `head` on
  `Vec (Suc n)` (as far as landed) / impossible-`VNil` head **known-gap**.
- **C5 · `verified-sort` · proof-carrying programs · B** — refinement emits both
  conjuncts PASS / `const Nil` (isSorted-only) **REJECT**.
- **C6 · `lawful-ord-vs-stub` · law-carrying instances · B** — law-**proved**
  `Ord` (zero-delta) / `Axiom`-stub `Ord` (grows trust base).
- **C7 · `quotient-respect` · observational / quotient · B** — intended
  quotient-elim pair; current fixtures cannot reach Quot-Form: `/` is integer
  division, and the sketches also lack a checked `e`. See the C7 README.
- **C8 · `funext-definitional` · observational / funext · B** — pointwise-equal
  functions equal via `Eq`-at-Pi (`\x.x` ≡ `\x. and_bool x True`) PASS /
  same proof shape over functions that **differ at a point** (`\x.True` vs
  `\x.x`) **REJECT**.

C1 and C7 tell **one story**: the naive `DecEq` over a non-canonical carrier
(C1) is unsound; a lawful quotient with a `respect` obligation is the sound
design target for C7. The current C7 fixtures still lack valid quotient
formation. C2 and C5 are coupled: C5's `Perm` must sit at the universe C2
establishes (`‖Perm‖`/count-equality, never a proof-relevant Ω inductive). C7
and C8 are the **two OTT faces** — C7 the *quotient* fragment (equality you
*impose*, gated by checked formation and `respect`), C8 the *funext* fragment
(equality that *computes* pointwise) — Ken's signature observational equality
from both sides.

## Grounding

The original challenge results were grounded against landed code/spec at
authoring (`origin/main`), cited per exercise. The C7 status update is
reconciled against `16 §5` and the current parser grammar. Surface examples
follow the landed catalog package
`catalog/packages/Core/Classes/LawfulClasses.ken.md`
(classes/instances/`Axiom`/`IsTrue`/`Equal`) and the `es2_acceptance.rs`
refinement form (`{ ys : List a | And (isSorted a leq ys) (Perm a ys xs) }`).
K5 `absurd` is the documented Bottom eliminator. The quotient kernel forms
`A / R / e`, `[t]`, and `elim_/` are specified in `11-syntax.md`. Where an
encoding pushes past the landed surface, that is
called out in the exercise as a **surface-expressibility note** — itself a
prepared depth result, not a defect in the instrument.

## How the operator runs it (when the time comes)

Each exercise dir carries its arm sources (`*.ken`) and a `README.md` with the
per-arm expected behavior + the one-line discriminator. Run each arm through the
`ken` CLI / elaborator and compare against the stated expectation. A
Flavor-A arm that **passes** (should have rejected) is the headline finding.
