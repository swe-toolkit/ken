# Canonical formatter acceptance seed — WP S

These cases are the black-box acceptance oracle for the canonical formatter
specified by `31-lexical.md §1`. They cover the eight semantic gates that B3
through C must make green. They do not prescribe a formatter representation or
add grammar. B1's lossless source layer and B2's token-kind printer are
prerequisites; B3, B4, and C own the observable outputs below.

**Status.** Every case that invokes `ken fmt`, compares formatter bytes, or
classifies formatted line width is **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B3/B4/C)**. Parse and
elaboration controls that do not invoke the formatter remain live. An
unparseable `ken ignore` or `ken reject` fence is deliberately exempt only from
structural layout: B2 token-kind canonicalization still applies where lexing
succeeds, and the original body layout otherwise remains byte-identical.

**Formatting-seed fixture census.** The marker above is occurrence 1 of 20 at
the candidate base. It is a scope declaration, not a fixture; the 18 marked
cases and FMT9's marked scope declaration are adjudicated in place below. Of
those 18 cases, 14 name fixtures the landed lexer and formatter surface can
produce. Four are blocked: three direct cases respectively require an ASCII
membership role, bracketed hexadecimal bytes, and user-declared fixity, while
FMT1 aggregates all three. The lexer emits `KwIn` for ASCII `in`, emits
`Member` only for source `∈`, and has no bracketed-byte token; the parser has
neither a membership-expression arm nor a fixity-declaration arm. No blocker
has landed any of those missing surfaces. Ownership is filed as
[[LANG-MEMBERSHIP-OPERATOR-SURFACE]], [[LANG-BYTES-HEX-LIST-LITERAL]], and
[[LANG-FIXITY-DECL-SURFACE]]; filing a blocker does not make its fixture
producible.

This census is formatting-seed-only. Seven markers elsewhere in conformance are
not swept: five in
`stdlib/collections/seed-cat3-collection-laws.md`, one in
`stdlib/collections/seed-cat4-maps-sets-relations.md`, and one in
`surface/bytes-io/seed-bytes-io.md`. Their fixtures turn on collections and
bytes-I/O machinery rather than the lexer/formatter surface.

The formatter is syntax-aware. Assertions compare parsed token roles, ASTs,
surface-to-core results, protected payload bytes, and masked prose bytes; raw
substring replacement is never an acceptable witness.

## FMT1 — byte fixed point (gate 1)

### surface/formatting/canonical-form-is-idempotent (property)

- spec: `31 §1a` (one canonical form), `31 §1d` (deterministic grouping and
  layout), WP S gate 1
- given: each fixture in FMT2–FMT8, including a long declaration, a broken
  arrow chain and application, nested matches, every protected literal form,
  interstitial comments, and all four literate fence roles
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B3/B4/C)** — byte-for-byte
  `fmt(fmt(source)) == fmt(source)`. The comparison includes final newline,
  blank lines, comment placement, fence markers, and Markdown outside fences.
- fixture: **BLOCKED-ON-MEMBERSHIP-ASCII-ROLE
  ([[LANG-MEMBERSHIP-OPERATOR-SURFACE]]),
  BLOCKED-ON-HEX-BYTE-LIST-SURFACE ([[LANG-BYTES-HEX-LIST-LITERAL]]), AND
  BLOCKED-ON-USER-FIXITY-SURFACE ([[LANG-FIXITY-DECL-SURFACE]])** — production
  exposes
  `format_ken` and `format_ken_md` for the other referenced fixtures, but this
  aggregate also includes all three unproducible direct cases: FMT8's ASCII
  membership role, FMT6's bracketed `0x[...]` bytes, and FMT8's user-declared
  fixity expression. All three blockers are filed, but none has landed its
  surface; production still has no surface for any of the three.
- why: a formatter that oscillates between flat and broken groups, relocates a
  comment on each pass, or repeatedly rewrites a fence marker can satisfy
  parse preservation while failing to define one canonical form. Byte identity
  is the non-degenerate observable.

---

## FMT2 — parse preservation (gate 2)

### surface/formatting/layout-preserves-parsed-program (property)

- spec: `31 §1a`/`§1c` (accepted aliases are the same token), `31 §1d`
  (formatting is not refactoring), WP S gate 2
- given: one parseable unit containing declarations, grouped binders, an open
  effect row, contracts, refinements, a record/class/instance block, a
  two-arm nested match, a lambda, `let`, `if`, a projection, a qualified path,
  and an attached-proof selector; format it once
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B3/C)** — parsing before and after yields equal
  ASTs after erasing spans and trivia and identifying only the sanctioned
  ASCII/Unicode aliases. Declaration and arm order, binder grouping,
  parentheses required by precedence, literal lexemes, type-application form,
  and attached-proof spelling are unchanged.
- fixture: **PRODUCIBLE** — `parse_lossless` supplies typed declarations and
  `format_ken` consumes that same `FormattableSource`; the landed parser has
  declaration, block, match, projection, qualified-path, and attached-proof
  arms for the named fixture families.
- why: the equality excludes exactly trivia and same-token notation. A printer
  that sorts, regroups, desugars, changes `Equal` to `==`, changes bracketed
  type application, or switches proof-reference form changes the compared AST
  and fails even when both outputs parse.

### surface/formatting/parse-control-same-ast-different-layout (control)

- spec: `31 §1c`, `32` (existing grammar)
- given: two unformatted parseable sources differing only in whitespace and
  accepted ASCII/Unicode aliases
- expect: both parse now and their ASTs are equal under the same comparison
  used above; this control is **LIVE** and does not invoke `ken fmt`
- why: separates a formatter failure from an absent parser capability and
  pins the sanctioned equivalence relation used by FMT2.

---

## FMT3 — elaboration preservation (gate 3)

### surface/formatting/layout-preserves-elaborated-core (property)

- spec: `31 §1d` (semantic preservation), `39` (surface-to-core
  elaboration), WP S gate 3
- given: a closed module whose name resolution depends on source order and
  contains a qualified import, a local binding, an instance constraint, a
  projection, and an attached-proof reference; elaborate the original and its
  formatted output under the same roots and entry unit
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B3/C)** — both elaborate successfully to the
  byte-identical stable core serialization and identical `trusted_base()`;
  resolved `GlobalId`s and declaration order are identical
- fixture: **PRODUCIBLE** — production exposes `format_ken`, `parse_lossless`,
  `resolve_decls`, and `ElabEnv::elaborate_file`; the B3 preservation controls
  already run the format/parse/resolve/elaborate path on closed sources.
- why: AST equality alone can miss a resolution, fixity, or source-order bug.
  The stable core result is structural: a formatter that reorders imports,
  fields, instances, or declarations cannot pass merely because both sources
  remain well-typed.

---

## FMT4 — whole-catalog posture (gate 4)

### surface/formatting/whole-catalog-preservation-and-fixed-point (property)

- spec: `31 §1a` (mandated formatter), `31 §1d`, WP S gate 4
- given: every `.ken` file and every parseable recognized Ken fence in the
  repository catalog, with no sampling and no allow-list of known hard files
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (C)** — each unit passes FMT1, FMT2, FMT3 wherever
  stable core comparison is available, FMT6, and FMT7. Every parseable `ken`,
  `ken example`, `ken ignore`, and `ken reject` body is included according to
  its role; deliberately invalid bodies use the narrow FMT8 exemption.
- fixture: **PRODUCIBLE** — the landed capstone enumerates plain catalog units
  and recognized literate fences, dispatching them through `format_ken` or
  `format_ken_md`; invalid eligible bodies take B4's lexed-token fallback.
- why: the catalog's long telescopes, nested proofs, comments, and literals are
  the formatter's real domain. A representative sample can be green while an
  unvisited production silently loses syntax or trivia.

---

## FMT5 — literate prose identity (gate 5)

### surface/formatting/literate-prose-is-byte-identical (property)

- spec: `31 §1d` (literate canonical form), WP S gate 5
- given: a `.ken.md` document with non-ASCII prose, trailing prose spaces,
  blank lines, inline code containing `->`, `|->`, `l`, `level`, and `in`, an
  unrecognized fenced language, and each of the four recognized Ken roles
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B4/C)** — mask each recognized fence from opener
  through closer, concatenate the remaining byte ranges, and compare them with
  the corresponding input ranges: they are byte-identical. Only recognized
  fence markers and bodies may differ. Adjacent fences are not joined or
  moved, and roles do not change.
- fixture: **PRODUCIBLE** — `extract_ken_md` exposes all four fence roles and
  byte ranges, while `format_ken_md` splices formatted bodies without rewriting
  the non-body ranges; B4's prose-identity control exercises this surface.
- why: ordinary prose contains bytes that resemble Ken aliases. Comparing the
  masked byte ranges catches a raw global canonicalizer or Markdown reflow;
  comparing only rendered text would not.

---

## FMT6 — comments and protected payloads (gate 6)

### surface/formatting/comments-retain-text-and-attachment (property)

- spec: `31 §1d` (comment preservation and attachment), WP S gate 6
- given: a doc comment before a declaration, a leading comment before a match,
  an end-of-line comment that fits, one that cannot fit, and a distinct comment
  between every adjacent pair of structural token classes across the fixture
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B3/C)** — every comment's text bytes are
  identical except trailing horizontal whitespace; doc and leading comments
  remain attached to the same AST node; a fitting EOL comment stays inline and
  the non-fitting one moves immediately above its same node. Each interstitial
  comment forces its containing group to break and crosses no token boundary.
- fixture: **PRODUCIBLE** — the lossless source records comment trivia and
  span-keyed attachments, and the landed layout tests exercise leading,
  interstitial, fitting EOL, and moved EOL comments through `format_ken`.
- why: comment presence alone is green-vs-green under misattachment. Node
  identity plus exact text and relative token interval make relocation
  observable.

### surface/formatting/all-literal-lexemes-are-verbatim (property)

- spec: `31 §1b`/`§1d` (token-kind canonicalization and protected regions),
  `31 §3` (literal forms), WP S gate 6
- given: one parseable fixture containing every literal category and spelling
  distinction: integers `1_000`, `0xFF`, `0b1010`, `0o17`; decimal
  `1_000.00d`; floats `1e-9`, `0x1p-3`; ordinary string, raw/multiline string,
  char, escaped char, `b"..."`, and `0x[...]` bytes; and both booleans. Every
  text-capable payload contains as many complete alias byte sequences as its
  grammar admits, including `->`, `|->`, `\\`, `forall`, `exists`, `Sigma`,
  `Pi`, `Omega`, `===`, `<=`, `>=`, `/=`, `not`, `/\\`, `\\/`, `in`, `<:`,
  `><`, `level`, and `l`. Foreign symbol/library strings, temporal formula
  text, line/block/doc comments, and Markdown prose carry the same alias set.
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B2/B3/B4/C)** — every literal and verbatim payload
  source lexeme is byte-identical after formatting: base, separators, suffix,
  exponent, delimiter, escape spelling, and payload all survive. Alias-looking
  bytes inside any protected region are not converted to glyphs.
- fixture: **BLOCKED-ON-HEX-BYTE-LIST-SURFACE
  ([[LANG-BYTES-HEX-LIST-LITERAL]])** — the blocker is filed, not landed.
  Production can lex the other listed literal families, but has no `0x[...]`
  byte-list token or AST path. Source `0x[` enters radix-integer lexing and
  fails for having no hexadecimal digit before `[`, so the complete fixture
  cannot be parsed and handed to `format_ken`.
- why: this exercises each literal form independently. Testing only an ordinary
  string would leave raw/multiline strings, chars, bytes, numeric spellings,
  comments, foreign names, and temporal payloads unguarded.

---

## FMT7 — deterministic 96-column property (gate 7)

### surface/formatting/breakable-syntax-never-exceeds-96-columns (property)

- spec: `31 §1d` (96 display columns, two-space indentation, deterministic
  group breaking), WP S gate 7
- given: paired fixtures at display widths 96 and 97 for a declaration header,
  arrow chain, application, match arm, effect row, contract, refinement, and
  record/class/instance field. Each displayed line is the actual rendered line
  in its smallest canonical carrier: top-level forms include their declaration
  carrier; the match arm includes the four source spaces contributed by its
  declaration body and `match`; the field includes its two block spaces. In
  every block below, the first line is the 96-column arm and the second adds
  exactly one identifier character:

  Declaration header:

  ```text
  fn declaration_header_boundary (a : Type) (value : Vector a n) : A → B = valuexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  fn declaration_header_boundary (a : Type) (value : Vector a n) : A → B = valuexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  ```

  Arrow chain:

  ```text
  const arrow_chain_boundary : Alpha → Beta → Gamma → Delta → Epsilon → Zeta = witnessxxxxxxxxxxxx
  const arrow_chain_boundary : Alpha → Beta → Gamma → Delta → Epsilon → Zeta = witnessxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  ```

  Application:

  ```text
  const app : R = apply (A → B) first_argument second_argument third_argument fourth_argumentxxxxx
  const app : R = apply (A → B) first_argument second_argument third_argument fourth_argumentxxxxxx
  ```

  Match arm inside
  `const match_boundary : R = match subject { … }`; the four leading spaces
  are source:

  ```text
      ExtremelyLongPattern a pattern_argument ↦ apply handler a pattern_argument additional_argxxx
      ExtremelyLongPattern a pattern_argument ↦ apply handler a pattern_argument additional_argxxxx
  ```

  Effect row:

  ```text
  proc effect_row_boundary (f : A → B) : IO A visits [Console, FileSystem, Network, Clock] = runxx
  proc effect_row_boundary (f : A → B) : IO A visits [Console, FileSystem, Network, Clock] = runxxx
  ```

  Contract:

  ```text
  space proc c (f : A → B) (x : A) : B requires predicate x ensures Equal B result (f x) = f xxxxx
  space proc c (f : A → B) (x : A) : B requires predicate x ensures Equal B result (f x) = f xxxxxx
  ```

  Refinement:

  ```text
  const refinement_boundary : {f : A → B | predicate f} = witnessxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  const refinement_boundary : {f : A → B | predicate f} = witnessxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  ```

  Field inside `class Boundary a { … }`; the two leading spaces are source:

  ```text
    field_boundary : Container (A → B) beta_argument gamma_argument delta_argument epsilon_argxxxx
    field_boundary : Container (A → B) beta_argument gamma_argument delta_argument epsilon_argxxxxx
  ```

  Unicode display-width measurement gives the following discriminating
  controls. Byte counts deliberately exceed display widths wherever a
  multibyte glyph occurs:

  | form | 96 arm | 97 arm |
  |---|---|---|
  | declaration header | 96 display / 98 bytes → flat | 97 display / 99 bytes → broken |
  | arrow chain | 96 display / 106 bytes → flat | 97 display / 107 bytes → broken |
  | application | 96 display / 98 bytes → flat | 97 display / 99 bytes → broken |
  | match arm | 96 display / 98 bytes → flat | 97 display / 99 bytes → broken |
  | effect row | 96 display / 98 bytes → flat | 97 display / 99 bytes → broken |
  | contract | 96 display / 98 bytes → flat | 97 display / 99 bytes → broken |
  | refinement | 96 display / 98 bytes → flat | 97 display / 99 bytes → broken |
  | record/class/instance field | 96 display / 98 bytes → flat | 97 display / 99 bytes → broken |
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B3/C)** — each 96-column form remains flat when
  its group fits; the paired 97-column form makes that same breakable group
  choose its specified multiline layout. Every output line over 96 is
  classified by a span wholly containing one indivisible identifier/literal or
  a specified verbatim region; no line exceeds 96 solely because breakable
  syntax was left flat. Indentation is two ASCII spaces per level, never tabs.
- fixture: **PRODUCIBLE** — `format_ken`, `display_width`, and the fixed
  `CANONICAL_WIDTH` are landed, and the B3/capstone controls feed parseable
  96/97 and indentation pairs through that production surface.
- why: every 96/97 pair fixes both boundary orientation and display-width
  counting. The paired arms differ by one ASCII identifier character while
  retaining multibyte Unicode syntax, so a byte-counting implementation or a
  vague best-effort wrapper flips at least one arm and fails.

---

## FMT8 — token-role ambiguity and literate boundary (gate 8)

Each pair below holds surrounding syntax fixed and changes only the token role
under test. The expected formatted tokens are structural outputs; merely
accepting both arms is insufficient.

### surface/formatting/function-arrow-and-match-arrow-stay-distinct (ambiguity)

- spec: `31 §1b`/`§1d`, `32` (`type` arrow and `arm` match arrow)
- given: an ASCII function type `A -> B` and a match arm `Some x |-> x`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B2/B3/C)** — output contains `A → B` and
  `Some x ↦ x`; neither token is printed as the other
- fixture: **PRODUCIBLE** — the lexer emits distinct `Arrow` and `MapsTo`
  kinds, and `canonicalize_tokens` maps them independently; B2's landed
  function/match-arrow control drives both through the production parser.
- why: longest-token and parsed-role discrimination. A raw `->` pass can
  corrupt `|->` while still producing arrow-looking text.

### surface/formatting/binding-colon-and-attached-selector-stay-distinct (ambiguity)

- spec: `31 §1d`, `32` (`:` and `::`)
- given: `(x : A)` adjacent to the reference `subject::proof_name`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B3/C)** — binding spaces around `:`, while `::`
  remains attached with no spaces; token count and roles are unchanged
- fixture: **PRODUCIBLE** — the lexer and parser expose distinct binding-colon
  and attached-selector paths, and `format_ken` consumes both through the
  lossless token stream.
- why: a punctuation pass that handles `:` before `::` changes the selector or
  inserts spaces that split it.

### surface/formatting/projection-and-qualified-path-keep-their-ast-roles (ambiguity)

- spec: `31 §1d`, `32` (`expr . ident` and qualified `path`)
- given: the same spelling `M.value` once resolved as a module-qualified path
  and once as field projection from local `M`, in otherwise identical calls
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B3/C)** — both print without spaces around `.`,
  and parsing the outputs preserves their distinct AST/resolution roles and
  `GlobalId`/projection targets
- fixture: **PRODUCIBLE** — the parser constructs dotted paths and projection
  expressions, while `resolve_decls` supplies the contextual distinction the
  formatter-preservation comparison observes.
- why: spelling identity is not role identity. The structural comparison
  catches a printer/parser path that silently reparses every dot as one class.

### surface/formatting/l-identifier-is-not-a-level-token (ambiguity)

- spec: `31 §1b`/`§1d` (semantic-name/source-lexeme distinction)
- given: one fixture containing
  `fn keep_level_glyph (ℓ : Nat) : Nat = ℓ`,
  `fn keep_l (l : Nat) : Nat = l`, and
  `fn keep_level_word (level : Nat) : Nat = level`; inspect each binder and use
  before formatting, then format the fixture
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B2/B3/C)** — all six identifier tokens carry the
  same stored `Ident("level")`. The formatted source preserves the three
  distinct binder/use lexeme pairs byte-for-byte as `ℓ`/`ℓ`, `l`/`l`, and
  `level`/`level`.
- fixture: **PRODUCIBLE** — the landed lexer maps each of `ℓ`, `l`, and `level`
  to `Ident("level")`; the lossless stream retains each source span, and
  `canonicalize_tokens` replays identifier lexemes unchanged.
- why: this is the direct raw-byte over-fire discriminator. A canonicalizer
  that collapsed all three sources to one spelling would satisfy the shared
  stored-name half but fail the three-lexeme preservation half.

### surface/formatting/in-keyword-and-membership-token-stay-distinct (ambiguity)

- spec: `31 §1b`/`§1d`, `32` (`let ... in ...` and membership `∈`)
- given: a `let x = value in body` expression beside membership written with
  its accepted ASCII alias in an otherwise fixed proposition
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B2/B3/C)** — the keyword remains ASCII `in`; the
  parsed membership operator prints `∈`
- fixture: **BLOCKED-ON-MEMBERSHIP-ASCII-ROLE
  ([[LANG-MEMBERSHIP-OPERATOR-SURFACE]])** — the blocker is filed, not landed.
  The lexer maps ASCII `in` only to `KwIn`, maps source `∈` to `Member`, and
  the parser has no membership-expression arm. Production therefore cannot
  assign the accepted ASCII bytes the membership role this `given` requires.
- why: the same input bytes occupy opposite token roles. Replacing every `in`
  either corrupts the keyword or fails to canonicalize membership.

### surface/formatting/lambda-and-dependent-arrow-remain-distinct (ambiguity)

- spec: `31 §1b`/`§1d` (canonical lambda `λ ... .`), `32`
- given: ASCII lambda `\\x. x` beside dependent arrow `(x : A) -> B x`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B2/B3/C)** — `λx. x` and
  `(x : A) → B x`; neither construct is desugared into the other
- fixture: **PRODUCIBLE** — the lexer emits distinct `Lambda` and `Arrow`
  kinds, the parser constructs both expressions, and token canonicalization
  maps their ASCII spellings independently.
- why: pins the S-owned lambda resolution and the distinct arrow role.

### surface/formatting/ascription-binder-fixity-and-associativity-survive (ambiguity)

- spec: `31 §1d`, `32` (precedence, binder lookahead, fixity)
- given: an expression ascription and dependent binder sharing `:`, a
  right-associated arrow chain, a left-associated application, arithmetic
  precedence, and a user-declared fixity expression
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B3/C)** — formatted output reparses to the exact
  same tree for each construct, inserting mandatory-clarity parentheses where
  needed but never changing grouping
- fixture: **BLOCKED-ON-USER-FIXITY-SURFACE
  ([[LANG-FIXITY-DECL-SURFACE]])** — the blocker is filed, not landed. The
  landed parser represents ascription, binders, arrows, application, and
  built-in arithmetic precedence, but exposes no fixity-declaration arm or
  user-fixity token. Production therefore cannot construct the named
  user-declared-fixity orientation.
- why: catches a pretty-printer that preserves tokens yet changes the parse at
  a line break or precedence boundary.

### surface/formatting/redundant-grouping-parens-are-removed (property)

- spec: `31 §1d` (parentheses follow precedence and mandatory clarity)
- given: the redundant grouping `(a + b)` beside the precedence-required
  `(a + b) * c` and an arrow type used as an application argument
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B3/C)** — the first prints as `a + b`; the second
  retains `(a + b) * c`; and the arrow-type argument retains its mandatory
  clarity parentheses. All three outputs reparse to their original ASTs.
- fixture: **PRODUCIBLE** — `parse_lossless` accepts all three parenthesized
  orientations and `format_ken` has a production parentheses/precedence path;
  producibility does not assert that the pending removal verdict is green.
- why: pins both orientations of canonical grouping. Preserving every source
  parenthesis fails the first arm; stripping every parenthesis fails a required
  or mandatory-clarity arm.

### surface/formatting/four-fence-roles-and-narrow-exemption (ambiguity)

- spec: `31 §1d` (the four literate roles and narrow exemption), WP S gate 8
- given: one `.ken.md` document with (a) parseable `ken`, (b) deliberately
  incomplete `ken ignore`, (c) deliberately syntax-erroring `ken reject`, and
  (d) parseable runnable `ken example`; all openers begin noncanonically but
  retain their exact role, and every body contains an accepted ASCII alias
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B2/B4/C)** — all four openers/closers become the
  canonical markers at column zero without changing role. The parseable `ken`
  and `ken example` bodies receive full structural layout. The unparseable
  `ignore` and `reject` bodies receive token-aware canonicalization only where
  tokens are recognized and otherwise retain body layout byte-for-byte.
  Markdown prose passes FMT5. A parseable `ignore` or `reject` body is formatted
  structurally; the exemption follows actual parse failure plus the eligible
  role, not role alone.
- fixture: **PRODUCIBLE** — `extract_ken_md` exposes all four roles and
  `format_ken_md` implements the parse-first split: parseable bodies take full
  layout, while unparseable `ignore`/`reject` bodies take
  `canonicalize_lexed_tokens`.
- why: the last sentence is the boundary discriminator. Exempting every
  `ignore`/`reject` fence under-formats valid code; attempting AST layout on an
  invalid body rejects the document. Holding body fixed and varying
  parseability makes either over-broad interpretation observable.

## FMT9 — B3 per-axis canonical-byte oracles

The expected bytes in this section are derived directly from `31 §1d`. They
are not snapshots of a formatter implementation. Each case has two
orientations: a non-canonical source must normalize to the displayed bytes,
and those displayed bytes must format to themselves. Every assertion is
**RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B3)** except a record-bearing input, which is
**RED-UNTIL (record-surface + B3)**.

The marker above is occurrence 19 of 20 at the candidate base. It is a scope
declaration, not a fixture. The landed parser and `format_ken` can produce the
embedded FMT9 families, including the record forms added after the historical
reachability measurement below; B3's
`ac6_reachable_fmt9_fences_remain_parse_preserved_after_horizontal_supersession`
drives every currently parseable embedded orientation without a hand-built
`FormattableSource`.

### surface/formatting/blank-runs-normalize-in-both-orientations (property)

- spec: `31 §1d` (physical text and spacing), B3 AC3
- given: one source with three blank lines between the two top-level
  declarations and two blank lines between the `record` fields; and a second
  source already byte-identical to the expected block below. The first source
  is exactly:

  ```ken
  const one : Nat = 1



  const two : Nat = 2

  record Pair {
    left : Nat;


    right : Nat
  }
  ```
- expect: both sources format byte-for-byte to:

  ```ken
  const one : Nat = 1

  const two : Nat = 2

  record Pair {
    left : Nat;
    right : Nat
  }
  ```

  The final `}` is followed by exactly one LF. Formatting those bytes again
  is byte-identical.
- why: the first orientation pins `2+ → 1` between top-level declarations and
  sibling `2+ → 0`; the canonical orientation prevents a formatter from
  oscillating or inserting a sibling blank line.

### surface/formatting/sibling-blank-collapse-is-b3-reachable (property)

- spec: `31 §1d` (zero blank lines between block siblings), B3 AC3
- given: this landed, parseable nonempty class block:

  ```ken
  class C a {
    foo : Nat;


    bar : Nat
  }
  ```

  and a second source already byte-identical to the expected block below
- expect: **RED-UNTIL-BUILT (B3)** — both sources format byte-for-byte to:

  ```ken
  class C a {
    foo : Nat;
    bar : Nat
  }
  ```

  Formatting those bytes again is byte-identical.
- fixture: **PRODUCIBLE** — the given is a landed nonempty class block;
  `parse_lossless` accepts it, and the FMT9 reachability control extracts this
  exact embedded source and feeds it through `format_ken`.
- why: this reconstructs the record fixture's construct-agnostic sibling
  blank-collapse invariant on a block that `parse_lossless` can produce now.
  The forward record fixture remains gated on record-surface, but B3 cannot
  regress `2+ → 0` while that future surface is absent.

### surface/formatting/fit-breaks-at-display-width-boundary (property)

- spec: `31 §1d` (96 display columns and deterministic fit), B3 AC1/AC3
- given: the following 96-display-column source, the same source with one
  additional `d` in its final identifier, and each expected output below as a
  canonical input:

  ```ken
  apply aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb cccccccccccccccccccc ddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
  ```
- expect: the 96-column group and its canonical input both produce one line:

  ```ken
  apply aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb cccccccccccccccccccc ddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
  ```

  The 97-column source and its canonical input both produce:

  ```ken
  apply
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
    cccccccccccccccccccc
    dddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
  ```

  The decision counts display columns after canonical token spelling, not
  UTF-8 bytes; each output is a byte fixed point.
- why: both sides of the fit boundary distinguish the ruled binary `group`
  decision from eager breaking, byte-width measurement, and over-wide flat
  output.

### surface/formatting/mandatory-breaks-ignore-available-width (property)

- spec: `31 §1d` (branching expressions and declaration blocks), B3 AC2
- given: narrow one-line spellings of each mandatory-break form, plus a second
  source already equal to each expected block below. The non-canonical inputs
  are exactly `match flag { True |-> yes; False |-> no }`,
  `match outer { Left |-> match inner { Only |-> value }; Right |-> other }`,
  `record Box { value : Nat }`, and `data OptionNat = None | Some Nat`.
- expect: a two-arm match formats to exactly:

  ```ken
  match flag {
    True ↦ yes;
    False ↦ no
  }
  ```

  a single-arm match nested as an arm body remains compound and formats to:

  ```ken
  match outer {
    Left ↦
      match inner {
        Only ↦ value
      };
    Right ↦ other
  }
  ```

  a nonempty declaration block formats to:

  ```ken
  record Box {
    value : Nat
  }
  ```

  This record pair is **RED-UNTIL (record-surface + B3)**; it is not an
  end-to-end B3 acceptance claim until the parser can produce a record
  `FormattableSource`.

  a declaration with the compound block body
  `fn compute (x : Nat) : Nat = let y = match x { Zero |-> 0; Suc n |-> n }
  in finish y` formats to:

  ```ken
  fn compute (x : Nat) : Nat =
    let y =
      match x {
        Zero ↦ 0;
        Suc n ↦ n
      }
    in
      finish y
  ```

  and a non-trivial sum formats to:

  ```ken
  data OptionNat =
    None
    | Some Nat
  ```

  Each displayed block is unchanged by another formatting pass, even though
  every line would fit within 96 columns.
- why: this isolates all four mandatory-break families and the nonempty-block
  rule. A fit-only printer would
  incorrectly flatten at least one narrow first orientation; a printer with
  unstable hard lines would change the canonical orientation.

### surface/formatting/siblings-use-spacing-not-alignment (property)

- spec: `31 §1d` (physical spacing and no alignment), B3 AC3
- given: a source whose field colons and assignment equals signs are padded
  into visual columns, plus a source already equal to the canonical bytes
  below. The non-canonical source contains:

  ```ken
  record Metrics { x           : Nat ; longer_name : Int }
  instance Defaults Nat { x           = 0 ; longer_name = 1 ; }
  ```
- expect: both format byte-for-byte to:

  ```ken
  record Metrics {
    x : Nat;
    longer_name : Int
  }

  instance Defaults Nat {
    x = 0;
    longer_name = 1
  }
  ```

  There is exactly one space on each side of every `:` and `=`, no padding to
  a sibling's column, and the result is a byte fixed point.
- why: accepting either input is green-vs-green for alignment. Exact unequal
  sibling bytes make global alignment and subsequent de-alignment observable.

### surface/formatting/separators-normalize-in-both-orientations (property)

- spec: `31 §1d` (spacing and declaration blocks), B3 AC3
- given: a non-canonical source with trailing block semicolons, missing or
  over-spaced sibling separators, and irregular commas in a record literal,
  record pattern, and named constructor argument; plus the canonical source
  below. Its exact non-canonical spelling is:

  ```ken
  record Pair { left:Nat ; right : Nat ; }
  fn swap (p:Pair):Pair=match p {{left ,right}|->{left=right ,right=left}}
  data Wrapped = Wrap { value:Nat ,valid :Bool }
  ```
- expect: both format byte-for-byte to:

  ```ken
  record Pair {
    left : Nat;
    right : Nat
  }

  fn swap (p : Pair) : Pair =
    match p {
      { left, right } ↦
        { left = right, right = left }
    }

  data Wrapped =
    Wrap { value : Nat, valid : Bool }
  ```

  Semicolons occur between declaration-block siblings and never trail the last
  sibling. Commas, with no preceding and one following space, separate record
  literal fields, record-pattern fields, and named constructor arguments.
  Reformatting the displayed bytes changes nothing.
- why: one generic punctuation assertion could pass while using semicolons in
  expression records or commas in declaration blocks. The three comma roles
  and the block-semicolon role are pinned independently in one exact output.

### surface/formatting/indent-is-two-space-enclosing-relative (property)

- spec: `31 §1d` (indentation, applications, and branching), B3 AC3
- given: a tab-indented and visually column-aligned spelling of the same nested
  expression, plus a source already equal to the expected bytes below. In the
  first source, every displayed indentation step below is one tab and the
  arguments align under the end of `apply` rather than under its enclosing
  continuation indent.
- expect: both format byte-for-byte to:

  ```ken
  const choose : Nat =
    match flag {
      True ↦
        apply
          first
          second;
      False ↦ zero
    }
  ```

  Each nesting step is exactly two ASCII spaces relative to its enclosing
  construct; there are no tabs and `first`/`second` do not align under the end
  of `apply`. The output is a byte fixed point.
- why: a coincidental-column `align` combinator can produce valid, stable text
  while violating enclosing-relative nesting. Exact leading bytes distinguish
  it from the ruled two-space form.

### surface/formatting/parentheses-have-one-canonical-owner (property)

- spec: `31 §1d` (precedence and the three mandatory-clarity cases), B3 AC4
- given: a non-canonical source containing `((a + b))`,
  `(((a + b)) * c)`, `consume (((A -> B)))`, and `f (((x : A)))`; plus a
  source already equal to the expected bytes below
- expect: after alias canonicalization, both format byte-for-byte to:

  ```ken
  const redundant : Nat = a + b

  const precedence : Nat = (a + b) * c

  const arrow_argument : R = consume (A → B)

  const ascribed_subexpression : R = f (x : A)
  ```

  The first arm loses every redundant grouping parenthesis. The lower-
  precedence infix operand, arrow type used as an application argument, and
  ascription used as a subexpression each retain exactly one required or
  mandatory-clarity pair. Parsing and elaborating before and after must retain
  the same AST and stable core result, and the displayed bytes are a fixed
  point.
- why: this is a controlled remove-versus-retain matrix. Preserve-all fails
  the first arm; strip-all fails three distinct ownership rules; adding extra
  clarity pairs fails the canonical-input orientation.

### surface/formatting/comments-pin-hard-lines-and-the-96-threshold (property)

- spec: `31 §1d` (comments), B3 AC5
- given: four paired fixtures, each once in a non-canonical placement and once
  already equal to its expected bytes. The non-canonical sources place a blank
  line between the leading comment and declaration, keep the interstitial
  comment inside the flat spelling
  `combine left -- keep this edge` with `right` on the following line, place
  the 96-column comment above its node, and leave the 97-column comment inline.
- expect: the leading-comment fixture formats to:

  ```ken
  -- choose the default
  const chosen : Nat = value
  ```

  The interstitial fixture formats to:

  ```ken
  const combined : Nat =
    combine
      left
      -- keep this edge
      right
  ```

  The comment remains between `left` and `right`, forces the enclosing
  application group to break, and cannot be flattened even when the whole
  expression is narrow. For the EOL boundary, the 67-character identifier
  makes the code 87 columns; `87 + 2 + 7 = 96` for the code, two separating
  spaces, and seven-column `-- note`, so the comment remains inline:

  ```ken
  const nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn : Nat = value  -- note
  ```

  With one additional identifier character, the sum becomes
  `87 + 1 + 2 + 7 = 97`, so the attached comment moves immediately above its
  node:

  ```ken
  -- note
  const nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn : Nat = value
  ```

  Comment text is byte-identical, except that trailing horizontal whitespace
  is removed. Every displayed output formats to itself.
- why: attachment identity plus exact bytes distinguishes relocation from mere
  retention. The 96/97 pair proves the threshold's two orientations, while
  the leading and interstitial pairs directly pin the no-flatten invariant.

### FMT9 reachability method and result

The fidelity gate embeds every expression fragment in the smallest complete
declaration that preserves its tokens, then calls `parse_lossless` on every
non-canonical input and every canonical expected block. The sweep runs against
the exact oracle base before the output assertions are assigned a build gate;
a hand-built `FormattableSource` is forbidden.

On `858c64a3` (with parser sources byte-identical at `267e8386`), the
mechanical sweep parsed all 29 reachable orientations and confirmed rejection
for all four record-surface orientations:

| Fixture family | Non-canonical | Canonical | Gate disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| blank runs, reachable class sibling control | parses | parses | B3 |
| 96/97 fit and indentation | parses | parses | B3 |
| match, nested match, compound `let`, sum | parses | parses | B3 |
| class/instance alignment and block separators | parses | parses | B3 |
| named-field constructor commas | parses | parses | B3 |
| parentheses and comment-placement pairs | parses | parses | B3 |
| any fixture containing record declaration/literal/pattern surface | rejects | rejects | record-surface + B3 |

`record` was the sole unbuilt construct found. The rejection is a reachability
classification, not a synthetic negative formatter test: those forward
oracles remain dormant until real source parsing can produce their input.

| 1. Idempotence | `canonical-form-is-idempotent` | B3/B4/C |
| 2. Parse preservation | `layout-preserves-parsed-program` | B3/C |
| 3. Elaboration preservation | `layout-preserves-elaborated-core` | B3/C |
| 4. Whole catalog | `whole-catalog-preservation-and-fixed-point` | C |
| 5. Prose identity | `literate-prose-is-byte-identical` | B4/C |
| 6. Trivia/literals | `comments-retain-text-and-attachment`, `all-literal-lexemes-are-verbatim` | B2/B3/B4/C |
| 7. Width | `breakable-syntax-never-exceeds-96-columns` | B3/C |
| 8. Ambiguity | all FMT8 cases | B2/B3/B4/C |
| B3 layout axes | all FMT9 cases | B3; record inputs also require record-surface |

## Cross-case consistency

- FMT2 and FMT3 use the same formatted unit: AST preservation and core
  preservation are independent requirements, not substitutes.
- FMT5 and the literal/protected-payload case compare disjoint byte ranges:
  Markdown prose outside fences versus lexemes and trivia inside recognized
  Ken regions. Together they rule out both global and in-language raw-byte
  rewriting.
- FMT7 permits an over-width line only when one classified indivisible or
  verbatim span itself forces it. That exception is semantic, not a formatter
  escape hatch, and cannot exempt surrounding breakable syntax.
- Every FMT8 ambiguity is a controlled pair. Correct and buggy printers produce
  different token kinds, ASTs, resolved targets, or bytes; none is a
  green-vs-green acceptance-only claim.
- The four-fence case is the sole structural-layout exemption. It is gated by
  both eligible role and actual parse failure; it never weakens token-aware
  canonicalization or prose identity.
- Every FMT9 expected block is derived from `31 §1d` before running a printer.
  Its paired non-canonical and canonical inputs must converge to the same
  independently fixed bytes; observed printer output is never an oracle.
