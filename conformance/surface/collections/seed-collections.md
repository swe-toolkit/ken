# L3 (strings & collections) conformance — seed cases

Format: `../../README.md`. These pin the **L3 deliverable**
(`docs/program/wp/L3-strings-collections.md`,
`spec/30-surface/37-strings-collections.md`): the **`String` UTF-8 primitive**
(canonically encoded, NFC-normalized, byte-length ≠ char-length, not
`List Char`),
the **core collection types** (`List`/`Option`/`Result` transparent inductive;
`Array` abstract with private representation — `Map`/`Set` are now the
**proved BST** of
`../../stdlib/map/seed-map.md`, superseding the heap model, see the supersession
note below), the **combinators with laws as propositions**, **infinitude without
coinduction** (the fuel-bounded inductive unfold + the structural-absence net),
and **structural equality**, the proved `Ord`-keyed `Map`/`Set`, and the
verified `sort` (which threads an **explicit comparator** since the
ES2-remainder §6 pin — the lawful-`Ord` class is **deferred**). **L3b (AC7)
records the user-type instancing crossing**, while its former `DecEq`-keyed Map
vehicle is superseded below; the user-`Ord`-drives-`sort` half remains deferred
to the lawful-`Ord` class. They extend —
and must not regress — the on-`main` surface invariants (`../seed-surface.md`,
`../data-match/seed-data-match.md`) and the `String` primitive already
registered for L6 (`../bytes-io/seed-bytes-io.md`).

**Supersession — `Map`/`Set` are now a proved BST
(`../../stdlib/map/seed-map.md`), not a heap primitive (OQ-A, 2026-07-03).** The
Map-container WP retires the opaque `DecEq`-keyed content-addressed heap
`Map`/`Set` this file originally pinned (kinds `0x07`/`0x08`,
insertion-order-independent canonical bytes, O(1) slot-id equality). Under
the landed `52-map.md` + the `37 §3.3` flip, `Map k v` and `Set a` are **proved,
pure `catalog/packages/` trees keyed on `Ord k`**, with **extensional** identity via
ordered `toList` (not O(1)-slot), **out of `trusted_base()`** (net-negative
TCB), and **no separate `DecEq k` keying constraint** — `Ord` is the single
keying faculty, key equality is the derived `leq k k' ∧ leq k' k` (`52 §2`). The
`Map`/`Set` behavioral corpus now lives in `../../stdlib/map/seed-map.md`
(subsume-don't-proliferate); the cases below tagged **(superseded →
seed-map.md)** retain only their non-`Map` content (e.g. the `List` half of the
O(1)-equality case) — their heap-`Map`/`Set` assertions are **void, do not code
to them**. `Array` retains durable kind `0x06`; its runtime representation is
private. Companion to the `/spec` supersession in `37 §3.3` this WP lands.

**Grounded (content-verified against the landed targets, not heading numbers —
the `conformance-oracle-grounding-fallback` discipline):** `14 §5` (`String` is
a primitive type — an opaque constant, trusted/audited by `18 §5`); the landed
`byte_length`/`char_length` `PrimReduction::Op` arms compute over literal values
in `ken-interp`, but remain opaque to kernel conversion pending K3 (the landed
`catalog/guide/proof-techniques.ken.md §1.1` primitive-`Op` `Refl` rejection is
the current control); `41 §2`/`§4` (immutable values, extensional equality,
and private runtime representation); `41 §3a` (durable kind tags
**`String 0x04`, `Array 0x06`**; `String` = NFC-normalized UTF-8 **at
construction**. The former heap `Map 0x07`/`Set 0x08`
kinds + their canonical-byte-encoding insertion-order-independent identity are
**retired** by OQ-A — `Map`/`Set` are proved `Ord k`-keyed trees with
extensional identity. Durable round-trip preserves that identity and ordered
observations; internal bytes, hashes, and deduplication outcomes are not
observable (`../../stdlib/map/seed-map.md`); `34 §1`/`§3`
(`List`/`Option`/`Result` inductive `data` + `elim_List`, **landed L2**);
`34 §5` (refinement types — the `sort` carrier); `33 §4` (a type exported
**abstractly** — name only, constructors hidden — the `Array`
opaque-carrier surface); `33 §5` (typeclasses as subobjects: **structure classes
`DecEq`/`Ord`**, the canonical-instance resolver convention, an unsatisfiable
constraint fails resolution = compile error); `42 §2` (`Lazy` is a thunk type
whose force/memo primitive **may be deferred for G1** — so the buildable-now
infinitude demo is the L2 unfold, **not** `Lazy`); `c3a3f1d`
(`L-resolver-globals`: an `EVar` scope-miss falls through to a global `RCon`
lookup — cross-declaration combinator references resolve). Cross-ref fidelity
verified at each target; no dangling forward-ref.

**Three staging facts that gate how a case is tagged (verified against the code,
not the frame):**
- **Primitive `Op` evaluation is runtime-only today.** `byte_length` and
  `char_length` are registered as `PrimReduction::Op` and have live
  interpreter value behavior, but `ken-kernel::conv::whnf` has no
  primitive-`Op` reduction arm. Therefore the byte/char **value discriminator is
  LIVE** through the interpreter, while any claim that the same equations close
  definitionally or by `Refl` is **DEFERRED/RED-UNTIL-K3**, conditional on K3
  actually registering those operations for conversion. Runtime evaluation is
  not evidence of kernel conversion.
- **NFC normalization is currently STUBBED** (landed runtime inspection:
  strings are encoded as-is). The spec pins NFC-aware equality as **normative**
  (`37 §2.1`), but the canonically-equivalent-string behavior **depends on real
  NFC landing**. So the NFC-equality case is **`(oracle)`-staged** (it asserts
  the
  spec's normative behavior, must **not** be run red against the stub — the
  `tag-deferred-seam-cases-at-elaboration-time` discipline). The byte-length ≠
  char-length fact is **NFC-independent** (a CJK/non-combining witness) and
  real.
- **`Array`/`Map`/`Set`, class/constraint resolution, the combinators, and
  `sort` are net-new elaborator surface** — none is registered in
  `ken-elaborator/src` today (only the `String` primitive, `List`/`Option`/
  `Result` L2 `data`, and the runtime value substrate are landed). Every
  positive case here therefore drives a **real new producer the build wires**,
  and the QA
  gate **producer-greps** that registration before counting green (the
  `conformance-hand-feeds-the-deliverable` net): **no synthetic collection
  literal, no hand-fed obligation, no hand-fed `DecEq` flag** where a real
  elaboration is asserted.

**Reading disciplines (what makes a case here load-bearing):**
- **Structural, not "compiles."** AC1 asserts **both** live interpreter values
  (`byte_length` **and** `char_length`) and their elaborated `Int` result type,
  not that an application type-checks and not that `Refl` closes; AC2 asserts
  the persistence observations (source unchanged, update correct), not a
  private sharing strategy; AC3/AC6 assert the **emitted obligation's shape**,
  not "it type-checks".
- **Verdict-flip / structural-flip on the target bug**
  (`discriminating-conformance-verdict-must-flip`): AC5 compares equal
  structures produced through distinct construction histories; AC2 flips if
  the source is mutated or an unrelated element changes; AC6's `Perm`
  conjunct flips against a `const Nil` sort.
- **Absence is pinned by CONSTRUCT signature, not lexeme** (`B2`/`Sec1-N1`
  absence-net carry, sharpened here): AC4's no-coinduction net targets the
  **AST/judgment node** (a `codata` former / a greatest-fixpoint type / `cofix`
  / a guardedness pass), and **names the benign homonyms** (`Lazy` thunk type,
  lazy-WHNF conversion strategy, stdlib `Stream` library type) so a grep cannot
  false-alarm on the word `lazy`/`stream` — and is **paired** with a working
  inductive infinitude producer (presence), since an absence case alone is the
  highest-risk kind.
- **Refinement must not be vacuous** (the discriminating-example discipline,
  `34 §5`): AC6 asserts the emitted obligation carries the **`Perm` conjunct**,
  because `isSorted`-alone is satisfied by `const Nil` (the empty list is
  vacuously sorted) — a sortedness-only obligation guards nothing.
- **One home per property** (`subsume-don't-proliferate`): the `String ↔ Bytes`
  partial decode and the round-trip law are **L6's** (`../bytes-io/`),
  referenced not re-pinned; the `data`/`match`/`elim_List` and
  refinement-carrier machinery are **L2's** (`../data-match/`), referenced; L3
  pins only what is L3-specific (collection shape, persistence, the laws, the
  no-coinduction decision, proved-Map `Ord` keying, `sort`).

**Tags.** `(soundness)` — a kernel **trusted-base** commitment whose wrongness
is a soundness bug: the no-coinduction structural absence (`37 §7`, a kernel
admission-gate commitment) and the `sort` obligation **completeness** (a dropped
`Perm` conjunct is a verification-soundness omission, the untrusted-layer
lesson). `(property)` — an invariant over many inputs / a law, not a single
trace. `(oracle)` — confirmed by the Spec enclave / at build time, safe as it is
**not** kernel-normative: unsettled prelude/op **spellings** (`get`/`index`,
`map`/…), the `Array` **internal representation**, whether `Set a` is literally
`Map a Unit`, and the **NFC-equality case** (pending real NFC, per the staging
fact above). The durable kind tags, byte/char length distinction,
convertible-view totalities, persistent value behavior, no-coinduction
absence, `isSorted ∧ Perm` refinement, and every live verdict are
**normative**. Runtime sharing is not.

## AC1 — `String` is a canonically encoded UTF-8 primitive (not `List Char`)

`String` is a `14 §5` primitive (opaque constant), uses durable kind `0x04`,
and is NFC-normalized at construction (`41 §3a`); it is **not**
`List Char` (a separate, convertible view, `37 §2.3`).

### surface/collections/string-byte-length-differs-from-char-length
- spec: `37 §2.2`; landed interpreter `prim_reduce` arms for `byte_length` and
  `char_length`
- given: an ASCII literal `"abc"` and a **single-code-point multi-byte** literal
  whose code point is **not combining and NFC-invariant** — a CJK scalar
  `U+4E16` (3 UTF-8 bytes, 1 code point), chosen so the byte/char gap is
  **independent of NFC normalization**.
- expect: through the **real interpreter**, `byte_length "abc"` and
  `char_length "abc"` both return `Int 3` (ASCII); for the CJK literal,
  `byte_length "世"` returns `Int 3` while `char_length "世"` returns `Int 1` —
  they **differ**. Assert both exact runtime values and the registered result
  type `String → Int`, not "it compiles" and not a single "length". This is a
  runtime/value oracle; it does **not** claim definitional equality or a proof by
  `Refl`.
- why: AC1's headline — treating `String` as packed UTF-8, not `List Char`,
  makes `byte_length` (stored bytes) and `char_length` (scalar count)
  **distinct**. A bug that conflates them (one `length` meaning bytes-or-chars
  ambiguously, or modeling `String` as `List Char` so `length ≡ char_length`
  only) is caught by asserting **both** differ on the multi-byte witness. The
  witness is NFC-invariant so this case is **real now**, independent of the NFC
  stub. (structural; both-views.)

### surface/collections/string-length-op-refl-deferred-k3
- spec: `37 §2.2`; K3 registered primitive-`Op` conversion is deferred
- given: proof declarations whose proposed bodies are `Refl` for
  `Equal Int (byte_length "abc") 3` and
  `Equal Int (char_length "世") 1`.
- expect: **DEFERRED / RED-UNTIL-K3.** On the landed kernel these applications
  remain neutral under conversion, so `Refl` does not close either declaration.
  Do not count the interpreter values from the live sibling case as conversion
  evidence. Activate the positive `Refl` oracle only if K3 lands registered
  conversion rules for these exact `Op`s; until then, the honest proof route is
  an explicit audited postulate/`Axiom`, not definitional computation.
- why: this is the discriminating runtime-vs-conversion boundary. A harness that
  evaluates with `ken-interp::prim_reduce` and then reports the proof accepted
  would hand-feed the result and falsely turn a tested runtime value into a
  kernel theorem. The live value case and this K3-gated proof case must remain
  separate. (deferred K3; proof reachability precondition; no hand-fed green.)

### surface/collections/string-is-not-list-char-but-convertible
- spec: `37 §2.3`, `35 §2.4` (`Char` = scalar value, surrogate-excluded)
- given: a `String` `s` and the four conversions of `37 §2.3`.
- expect: `String` and `List Char` are **distinct types** (a `String` is **not**
  accepted where a `List Char` is required without an explicit conversion).
  `String → List Char` is **total** (decode the `char_length`-long view);
  `List Char → String` is **total** (encode UTF-8 then NFC-normalize —
  and cannot encode an invalid scalar, since `Char` excludes the surrogate block
  `U+D800–U+DFFF`, `35 §2.4`). The `String ↔ Bytes` pair (`String → Bytes`
  total; **`Bytes → String` partial → `Result`**) is **L6's home**
  (`../bytes-io/seed-bytes-io.md`, `text-from-bytes-requires-named-decode`) —
  **referenced, not re-pinned**.
- why: AC1's "not `List Char`" face + the convertible-view **totalities** at the
  spec's locked granularity. The one partial direction (`Bytes → String`) is the
  L6 decode boundary; pinning it here would duplicate L6, so this case pins the
  **L3-new** `String ↔ List Char` totalities and references L6 for `Bytes`. A
  bug that makes `String = List Char` (no distinct type) or makes
  `List Char → String` partial (admitting invalid scalars) is caught.
  (type-distinction + totality.)

### surface/collections/string-nfc-canonically-equal (oracle)
- spec: `37 §2.1`, `41 §3a` (NFC at construction)
- given: two `String` literals that are **canonically equivalent under NFC** but
  spelled differently in source — the precomposed `U+00E9` ("é") and the
  decomposed `U+0065 U+0301` ("e" + combining acute).
- expect: `s == t` is true, their durable canonical bytes are identical, and
  the runtime results of `byte_length s` and `byte_length t` are equal over the
  normalized bytes. This is a value assertion, not a `Refl` or representation
  claim.
- why: AC1's canonical-NFC face — the normative `37 §2.1` behavior.
  **`(oracle)`-staged:** NFC normalization is currently **stubbed**
  (strings are currently encoded as-is), so this asserts the spec's normative
  target and must **not** be run red against the stub — it
  is confirmed when real NFC lands (the `tag-deferred-seam` discipline). The
  byte/char case above is the NFC-independent, real-now sibling. (oracle; NFC
  normative target.)

---

## AC2 — collections are immutable + persistent

`List`/`Option`/`Result` are transparent inductive `data` (L2, landed);
`Array` is abstract; `Map`/`Set` are proved package values. An update returns a
new value and leaves its source unchanged; allocation and structural sharing
are private (`41 §2`).

### surface/collections/list-pattern-matches-via-real-elim
- spec: `37 §3.1`, `34 §1`/`§3` (`List` inductive `data`, `elim_List`)
- given: `match xs { Nil => …; Cons h t => … }` for `xs : List a`.
- expect: the `match` lowers through the **real `elim_List`** (`34 §3`) — the
  same L2 eliminator, not a special collection protocol; `Nil`/`Cons` are real
  constructors a program may `match` on (`List` is **transparent**, `37 §3.1`).
  Assert the lowering to `elim_List` (structural), reducing by ι on a
  constructor scrutinee.
- why: AC2's transparent-inductive face. `List` is the **canonical** collection
  for proofs precisely because it rides L2 directly — no new kernel rule, no
  collection-specific elimination. This case drives the **landed** `elim_List`
  (real producer, testable now). A bug introducing a bespoke list eliminator
  (bypassing `34 §3`) is caught by asserting the `elim_List` lowering.
  (structural; landed mechanism.)

### surface/collections/array-update-preserves-unchanged-values
- spec: `37 §3.2`/`§3.4`, `41 §2`
- given: an `Array a` `v` of several elements; `w = set i x v` updating one
  index `i`.
- expect: `w[i] == x`; every other index has the same extensional value as in
  `v`; and `v` is unchanged after the update. The case does not inspect
  pointers, slots, or substructure identity.
- why: AC2 pins the observable persistence contract. A mutating `set` or an
  update that changes an unrelated element flips the result. Deep-copy and
  structural-sharing implementations both pass. **Net-new producer:** the QA
  gate producer-greps the real `Array` registration + `set`, not a
  hand-constructed result. (persistent value; hand-feed net.)

---

## AC3 — combinators have laws as propositions

`map` and `filter` are imported package functions from
`Data.Collections.Derived`, not prelude `view`s (`37 §4`). This seed makes no
placement claim about `fold`/`reduce` or `zip`. The laws are
`≡`-propositions discharged by the prover, adding **no kernel rule**.

### surface/collections/functor-law-emits-obligation-cross-decl-resolves
- spec: `37 §4`, `33 §3.2`/`§3.3`, `22` (obligation emission)
- given: in the compilation unit containing `map_id`, explicitly import
  `Data.Collections.Derived (map)` and
  `Core.Function.Combinators (idf as id)`. State
  `map_id : map id xs ≡ xs` in a declaration **separate** from the package
  declaration of `map`.
- expect: two faces. **(a) Resolution (real, landed):** the lowercase
  `map` reference in `map_id` resolves through the explicit package import;
  it does **not** error `UnboundName`. **(b) Obligation (net-new):**
  elaborating `map_id` **emits a real `≡`-obligation** `map id xs ≡ xs` to the
  `22` pipeline (a proposition, `14 §5`/`21 §3`), dischargeable by the prover —
  observe the **emitted obligation**, not "it type-checks".
- why: AC3 — imported combinator laws remain propositions, **structural on the
  emitted obligation**. Explicit imports make the provider context visible under
  `33 §3.3`; the case does not claim ambient prelude availability. Face (b)
  drives the **net-new** law emission (producer-grep the real `22` emission,
  not a synthetic obligation). A bug emitting **no** obligation (treating the
  law as a comment) or failing to resolve the imported `map` is caught.
  (structural obligation; explicit-import context.)

### surface/collections/map-lookup-insert-law-emits-obligation
**(SUPERSEDED → `../../stdlib/map/seed-map.md`.** These are now the **proved**
`52 §5.2` `lookup` laws — real proof terms, `Ord k`-keyed, not `DecEq`; live
home `stdlib/map/laws-real-proofs-zero-new-delta`. The obligation-emission shape
below is retained as generic combinator-law coverage.**)**
- spec: `37 §4`, `52 §5.2` (proved `lookup` laws, `Ord k`-keyed), `22`
- given: the canonical algebraic `Map` spec —
  `lookup_insert_eq : lookup k (insert k v m) ≡ Some v` and
  `lookup_insert_neq : k ≠ k' → lookup k (insert k' v m) ≡ lookup k m`.
- expect: each elaborates to a **real emitted `≡`-obligation** over the `Map`
  operations (dischargeable as a proposition); the second carries the `k ≠ k'`
  **premise** (a hypothesis discharged into the obligation, not dropped).
  Observe the emitted obligations structurally.
- why: AC3 on a **distinct law shape** (the associative-array algebra, not the
  functor law) so the two AC3 cases are not the same witness. The
  premise-carrying `neq` law guards against an elaborator that drops the
  hypothesis (emitting an unconditional, **false**
  `lookup k (insert k' v m) ≡ lookup k m`). **Net-new producer.** (structural
  obligation; distinct mechanism.)

---

## AC4 — no coinduction (structural absence) + inductive infinitude (the pair)

The §1 decision (state inductively, do not coinduct) is enforced by a
**structural-absence net** pinned by **construct**, paired with a working
**inductive** infinitude producer so the absence is not the only evidence.

### surface/collections/no-coinductive-construct-in-kernel (soundness)
- spec: `37 §7`, `14 §8` (strict positivity — the only inductive gate), `17 §4`
  (SCT — the only recursion gate)
- given: the kernel + surface admission machinery (`crates/ken-kernel`,
  `crates/ken-elaborator`).
- expect: **no coinductive type former** (no `codata` declaration form, no
  greatest-fixpoint type constructor, no `Stream`/`Colist` **kernel** type);
  **no `cofix` / copattern term former**; **no productivity or guardedness
  checker pass**. The kernel's **sole** structural admission gates are **strict
  positivity** (`14 §8`, for inductives) and the **SCT termination measure**
  (`17 §4`, for recursion) — there is **no dual guardedness analysis**. The net
  asserts the absence of the **construct** (the `codata`/`cofix`/guardedness AST
  node or kernel judgment), **naming the benign homonyms** so it targets the
  construct, not a word: **`Lazy`** (`42 §2`) is a **thunk type**, not
  coinduction; **lazy WHNF** (`42 §1`) is the conversion **strategy**, not a
  productivity rule; a stdlib **`Stream`** (`37 §5`) is a **library type** over
  inductive idioms.
- why: AC4's headline guardrail and the §1 durable decision. **`(soundness)`** —
  a coinductive former / guardedness gate slipping in is a kernel
  admission-soundness change. **Construct-not-lexeme (the B2/Sec1-N1 carry):** a
  lexeme grep for `lazy`/`stream`/`guard` false-alarms (these words are
  pervasive ordinary vocabulary — `guard` alone is dozens of
  positivity/underflow/arity guards) **or** is tuned permissive enough to miss a
  real `▷`-style former; the net must target the **formation rule / admission
  gate** (its AST/judgment), and **disconfirm**: the case is guard-gated (not
  coincidental) because it pins that the **only** admission gates are positivity
  + SCT, so a new guardedness pass would be a **new gate** the net detects, not
  an absent string. Grounded: the kernel today has **zero**
  `codata`/`cofix`/`corecursion`/guardedness construct. (soundness;
  construct-signature absence, named homonyms.)

### surface/collections/fuel-bounded-unfold-produces-finite-prefix
- spec: `37 §5` (item 1, the mandated demo), `34 §1` (`List`/`Option`/`Nat`
  inductive `data`), `17 §4` (SCT)
- given: `unfoldUpTo : (s → Option (a × s)) → Nat → s → List a`, the
  structurally-recursive unfold of `37 §5` (recurses on the `Nat` fuel), applied
  with a concrete step and fuel `n`.
- expect: `unfoldUpTo step n s` **reduces to a finite `List` prefix** of length
  ≤ `n` (terminating by **structural descent on the `Nat` fuel**, SCT-accepted,
  `17 §4`) — an **ordinary total `List`-producing function** over the landed
  `34 §1` `data`, with **no** coinductive value, **no** `Lazy`, **no** effect.
  Assert it produces a concrete prefix **and** that SCT **accepts** the
  recursion.
- why: AC4's **presence** half — infinitude served the **inductive** way, the
  non-degenerate **pair** with the absence net (an absence case alone is
  highest-risk). This is the **mandated** buildable-now demonstration and it
  rests **only on landed L2** (not the deferred `Lazy` force/memo, `42 §2` — the
  defer-spelling-not-concept / B2 carry: a buildable-now deliverable must not
  depend on a deferred spelling). A bug making this the *only* way (no `Lazy`
  ever) is fine; a bug requiring a coinductive value to stream is what §1
  forbids. (reduces-to + SCT-accepts; landed L2.)

---

## AC5 — structural equality

Equality is structural/extensional and representation-independent (`41 §4`);
the proved `Map`/`Set` carrier is keyed by lawful `Ord` (`52 §2`). The former
`DecEq`-keyed Map rows below are retained as explicit supersession records,
not live producers.

### surface/collections/structurally-equal-collections-compare-equal
- spec: `37 §6`/`§3.3`, `41 §4`, `52 §5.3`
- given: two `List` values built by different expressions but **structurally
  equal**; and (richer) two `Map` values built in **different insertion orders**
  with the same key→value content.
- expect: the two `List`s compare equal. The same-content `Map`s compare equal
  extensionally via ordered `toList` (`52 §5.3`;
  `../../stdlib/map/seed-map.md`). No pointer, slot, or complexity result is
  asserted.
- why: AC5's equality face is representation-independent. A bug that makes
  equality depend on insertion order or allocation path is caught.
  (structural/extensional equality.)

### surface/collections/map-key-without-deceq-rejected
**(SUPERSEDED → `../../stdlib/map/seed-map.md`.** The keying constraint is now
`where Ord k` (`52 §2`), **not** `DecEq k` — a key type without a lawful `Ord`
is rejected, and a non-canonical `Ord` key (e.g. `Decimal`) is unlawful
(`52 §2.1`). Live home `stdlib/map/noncanonical-key-not-a-lawful-map-key`.**)**
- disposition: no active `given`/`expect` remains here. The lawful `Ord`
  accept/reject pair lives in `../../stdlib/map/seed-map.md`.

---

## AC6 — the verified `sort` (the `Perm` conjunct is load-bearing)

`sort` threads an **explicit comparator** `leq : a → a → Bool` (the pinned §6
surface — the lawful-`Ord` class is **deferred**, `37 §6`) and produces the
refinement `{ ys : List a | isSorted leq ys ∧ Perm ys xs }` (`34 §5`); the
elaboration **emits the conjoined obligation**.

### surface/collections/sort-emits-issorted-and-perm (soundness)
- spec: `37 §6`, `34 §5` (refinement obligation), `22 §2.1`
- given: `view sort {a} (leq : a → a → Bool) (xs : List a) : R = …`, where the
  refinement `R = { ys : List a | isSorted leq ys ∧ Perm ys xs }` (`34 §5`) —
  the **explicit-comparator** surface (ES2-remainder pin; no `where Ord a`).
- expect: the result-introduction **emits the conjoined refinement obligation**
  `isSorted leq (sort leq xs) ∧ Perm (sort leq xs) xs` (`34 §5`, `22 §2.1`),
  dischargeable by a verified `sort` with a bundled proof. Assert the emitted
  obligation carries **both** conjuncts — **specifically that the
  `Perm (sort leq xs) xs` conjunct is present**, not `isSorted`-alone.
- why: AC6 — the canonical verification example, **structural on the emitted
  obligation**, and the **refinement-must-not-be-vacuous** discriminator.
  `isSorted`-alone is **degenerate**: `sort _ = Nil` satisfies
  `{ ys | isSorted leq ys }` (the empty list is vacuously sorted), so a
  sortedness-only obligation is met by a **`const Nil`** implementation that
  discards the input — it guards nothing. The `Perm` conjunct forces `sort` to
  **be** a sort. **`(soundness)`** via the untrusted-layer **omission** lesson:
  the bug is the elaborator **emitting only `isSorted`** (silently dropping
  `Perm`) — a never-generated conjunct supplies no proof obligation and reads
  `proved`-by-default, a verification-soundness gap the kernel does **not**
  catch. The case asserts the **completeness** of the emitted obligation (both
  conjuncts present), not just that **an** obligation fires. **Net-new

## AC7 — user-type `DecEq`/`Ord` instancing (L3b — the §6 gate crossing)

L3 pinned user-type instance search before OQ-A retired the `DecEq`-keyed Map
carrier. The former Map vehicle remains below only as a supersession record.
The **`Ord` half is deferred**:
ES2-remainder's §6 pin gives `sort` an **explicit comparator** and defers the
lawful-`Ord` class, so `sort` (and ordered `Map`/`Set` ops) resolve **no** user
`Ord` today — the two user-`Ord`-drives-`sort` cases below are gated on the
future lawful-`Ord`-class WP (they must **not** run green against today's
empty-stub `Ord`). None of these re-pin the base properties (one home per
property, `subsume-don't-proliferate`). No new kernel rule (§37 banner): pure
elaborator wiring of the collection ops to the landed resolver.

### surface/collections/user-deceq-instance-keys-map-via-real-search
**(SUPERSEDED framing → `../../stdlib/map/seed-map.md`.** The **resolver**
coverage (`instance_search` returns `Some`/`None` for a user instance — Lc
`4aa36c7`, `classes.rs:91`) survives as general class-resolution coverage, but a
`Map` is now keyed by `Ord k` (`52 §2`), so the user-`Map`-keying vehicle
re-points to a user `instance Ord K`.**)**
- disposition: no active `given`/`expect` remains here. Generic resolver
  coverage remains outside this retired Map-specific vehicle; lawful Map
  keying lives in `../../stdlib/map/seed-map.md`.

### surface/collections/user-ord-instance-drives-verified-sort (deferred)
- spec: `51-lawful-classes.md` (the lawful `Ord` class + `where Ord a` supplying
  `d.leq`, `33 §5.4`), `37 §6`, `34 §5`, `33 §5`/`39 §6`
- **deferred — the coupling this case tests does not exist on `main` yet.** The
  ES2-remainder §6 pin makes `sort` take an **explicit comparator**
  `leq : a → a → Bool` (no `where Ord a`) and ordered `Map`/`Set` ops use
  built-in comparators, so **nothing** resolves a user `Ord` instance today;
  and the landed `Ord` class is an **empty stub** carrying **no** law fields.
  Asserting "the `Ord` dictionary carries the total-order law proofs the prover
  uses" against that stub is **green-vs-green** — it passes with zero
  law-carrying content. This case is **gated on the ES4-classes WP**
  (`51-lawful-classes.md` — spec **pinned**; the Team-Language build follow-on
  lands the `Ord`) that (a) builds `Ord` instances **actually carrying** the
  total-order law proofs (`refl`/`antisym`/`trans`/`total`, `51 §5` — not stubs;
  the `stdlib/classes/law-fields-real-proofs-not-postulates` net) and
  (b) supplies the instance's `leq` (`d.leq`) to `sort` via `where Ord a`
  (`51 §4`, `33 §5.4`). **Un-defers on that build**, not on this spec pin.
- given (on that WP): a user type `K` with (a) a user `instance Ord K`
  (law-carrying), and (b) the **same** `K` with **no** `Ord K` — each used in a
  `where Ord a`-constrained `sort (xs : List K)` (and an ordered op, e.g.
  `minKey`)
- expect (on that WP): **the verdict flips.** (a) **accepts** —
  `instance_search("Ord", "K")` returns `Some(id)`, the desugaring threads its
  `leq`, `sort` type-checks and its refinement obligation is discharged with the
  instance's law proofs; (b) **rejects** — `instance_search` returns `None`, a
  **no-instance error naming the missing `Ord K`**
- why: (L3b-AC2, deferred) user `Ord` drives the verified `sort` **once the
  lawful class + desugaring land**; the reject arm + the **law-carrying**
  dictionary (not the empty stub) are the guard. Until then the
  explicit-comparator `sort` emission is pinned comparator-side by
  `sort-emits-issorted-and-perm`.
  (deferred; do **not** count green against today's empty-stub `Ord`.)

### surface/collections/user-ord-sort-emits-both-conjuncts (soundness, deferred)
- spec: `51-lawful-classes.md` (`where Ord a` supplies `d.leq`, `§4`), `37 §6`,
  `34 §5` (refinement obligation), `22 §2.1`
- **deferred — no user-instance `sort` path exists on `main` yet.** Post-pin
  `sort` takes an explicit `leq` and has **no** `Ord`-resolved path (built-in or
  user), so there is no user-`Ord` `sort` site whose emission could regress.
  This case is **gated on the same ES4-classes WP** (`51-lawful-classes.md`;
  `where Ord a` supplying `d.leq` re-introduces the user-instance `sort` path) —
  **un-defers on that build**, not on this spec pin.
- given (on that WP): a `where Ord a`-constrained `sort (xs : List K)` where
  `Ord K` is a **user** `instance Ord K` resolved via
  `instance_search("Ord", "K")` and desugared to threading its `leq`
- expect (on that WP): the result-introduction **emits the conjoined
  obligation** `isSorted leq (sort xs) ∧ Perm (sort xs) xs` — **both conjuncts,
  `Perm` present** — identically to the explicit-comparator base; the emission
  does **not** regress through the desugaring
- why: (L3b-AC3 ★, deferred) (soundness) the VC-emission must **not regress
  through the `where Ord a` desugaring** onto the user-instance path. Extends
  the base completeness (`sort-emits-issorted-and-perm`, which is the **live**
  home for both-conjuncts/`Perm`-load-bearing/`const Nil`-degeneracy) — it pins
  that **desugaring `where Ord a` to the threaded `leq` preserves the conjoined
  emission**. **Discriminating (on that WP):** a build whose desugaring emits
  the VC for the explicit-comparator form but **drops `Perm` (or the whole
  obligation) on the desugared user-`Ord` path** passes the base yet **fails
  here** — the untrusted-layer **omission** (a never-generated conjunct reads
  `proved`-by-default; the kernel does not catch it). Producer (on that WP):
  grep the **emitted** obligation at the `sort` result site **on the desugared
  path** — not "it type-checks." (deferred; the live emission net is the
  explicit-comparator base.)

### surface/collections/user-deceq-keyed-map-canonical-identity
**(SUPERSEDED → `../../stdlib/map/seed-map.md`.** This case's entire premise —
insertion-order-independent O(1)-slot `Map` identity via canonical byte-encoding
— is **retired** by OQ-A. A proved BST has **extensional** identity via ordered
`toList` (`52 §5.3`); it is **not** byte-order-interned and **not**
insertion-order-canonical. No replacement O(1)-slot `Map`-identity case exists —
the property is gone; the live ordering home is
`stdlib/map/tolist-ascending-by-key`.**)**
- spec: **retired** — see `52 §5.3` + `../../stdlib/map/seed-map.md`
- disposition: no active `given`/`expect` remains here. The live proved-Map
  producer compares extensional ordered contents and does not observe storage.

## Derived string surface (slice 2) — the `List Char` floor + 5 string ops

**Slice 2/2 of the string surface** (WP `L3-strings-surface`, `191b023`;
`spec/30-surface/37-strings-collections.md` §2.4/§2.5/§2.5.1/§4.1, DS-AC1–7 in
§9). Delivers the derived string operations — `concat`/`slice`/`charAt`/
`eq`/`compare` over `String` — as (a) a minimal **7-combinator `List Char`
floor** (`list_append`/`nth`/`take`/`drop`/`natSub`/`list_eq`/`list_compare`)
built as termination-checked recursive derived defs over the **real** generic
`Term::Elim` (`34 §3`), and (b) the 5 string ops derived on top, routed through
the now-real `string_to_list_char` (`s2l`) / `list_char_to_string` (`l2s`)
(slice 1, `f50be22`). **Zero new native prims, zero `trusted_base()` delta**
(Approach A, Architect ruling `evt_4k1yqah3yvpds`).

**Grounded (content-verified against the landed code at `191b023`, not the frame
prose — the frame's "landed" premises are perishable, and two were stale):**
`s2l`/`l2s` real (`crates/ken-interp/src/eval.rs` — the `Neutral` fallback arms
are reached only when `store.list_char_ids` is unwired; the real reduction fires
when it is, as slice 1); the `natSub` saturating-monus shape + the local
`data OrdResult = Lt | Eq | Gt` + `natCmp` 3-way **precedents** elaborate + SCT-
pass today (`crates/ken-elaborator/tests/val1_string_literals.rs:327`/`:334`,
with the ES2 sanction-comment "a genuine 3-way comparison still gets one,
declared locally"); `Ord Char` is **`leq`-only**
(`instance Ord Char { leq refl antisym trans total }`, no `compare` method,
`catalog/packages/Core/Classes/LawfulClasses.ken.md:359`); `eqChar`/`leqChar` landed
(`= eq_int`/`= leq_int` under `Char`'s `Int` erasure,
`crates/ken-elaborator/src/decimal_char.rs:242`); the
`map`/`zip`/`unfoldUpTo`/`insert` recursion precedents landed
(`l3a_acceptance.rs`).

**Two stale frame-premise corrections (do NOT inherit the frame's prose — spec
reconciled them, `§4.1`/`§2.5.1`, Architect `evt_1stp9sspm6ag8`):**
- **The floor is 7 combinators, not 6.** The frame's `sub` (for `slice`'s
  length) is **not landed** — no `Nat` subtraction exists (only signed
  non-saturating `sub_int`), so `natSub` (saturating monus) is a 7th derived
  combinator.
- **`compare` is 3-way over a local `OrdResult`, not `Ordering`.** The frame's
  `compare = list_compare (Ord Char).compare : Ordering` names a **type and a
  method that do not exist** on `main` (`Ord Char` is `leq`-only; no `Ordering`/
  `OrdResult` type). It is delivered 3-way over a **locally-declared, string-
  surface-exported checked inductive** `data OrdResult = Lt | Eq | Gt`, with
  `compareChar` **repackaging** the landed `leqChar`/`eqChar` (`Eq` on `eqChar`;
  else `Lt`/`Gt` by `leqChar`). So `compare` cases assert `OrdResult` values
  (`Lt`/`Eq`/`Gt`), **never** an `Ordering` or a `Bool`.

**Deliverability honesty — this WP ships the value-level FUNCTIONS, not lawful
instances (the trust level, `§2.5`).** `eq : String → String → Bool` and
`compare : String → String → OrdResult` are Boolean/decision operations in the
**tested-not-trusted** interpreter ring ("a wrong value, never a false proof").
`String` **is** canonical w.r.t. `List Char`: the landed String-side
`l2s (s2l s) ≡ s` retraction makes `s2l` injective (ADR 0010 §2), so
`DecEq String`/`Ord String` **instances** are *soundly deliverable* later —
unlike `Decimal`, whose non-canonical carrier makes `DecEq Decimal` inhabit
`Bottom`
(`../numbers/seed-numbers.md`, `../10-kernel/18a §5.6.1(4)`,
`deceq-on-noncanonical-carrier-inhabits-bottom`). But that transport
additionally needs a **lawful `DecEq Char`**, which is **not yet landed** (only
the `eqChar` *view* + `Ord Char`-by-transport are on `main`); so the proof-
carrying `DecEq String`/`Ord String` instances are a **tracked follow-on** (the
lawful-`Ord`/`DecEq`-class WP, AC7 above; `48`), **not** delivered here. Filing
these *functions* as proof-carrying instances would over-claim the trust level
(`trusted-by-typing-guarantee-is-not-kernel-proved-Q`).

**Reading disciplines specific to this slice:** producer-grep the **real**
7-combinator registration (net-new on `main` — grep-verified absent at
`f50be22`: `list_append`/`list_eq`/`list_compare` have **zero** hits;
`nth`/`take`/`drop` only lexical false-positives like `std::mem::take` — so a
green must drive the real producer, the `conformance-hand-feeds-the-deliverable`
net); DS-AC4 is a **non-degenerate accept+reject pair** (COORDINATION §7) plus
the **NFC-blindness** pin at the `list_eq` layer (unconditional there); assert
result **values** (`Lt`/`Eq`/`Gt`, not `Ordering`); the SCT check stays in its
**sound zone** (applied call on a strict subterm), not the over-accept zone
(`sct-unapplied-self-reference-over-accepts`).

### surface/collections/list-combinator-floor-derived-over-real-elim
- spec: `37 §4.1` (the 7-combinator floor), `34 §3` (real `Term::Elim`),
  `18a §5` (small audited core)
- given: the 7 floor combinators (`list_append`/`nth`/`take`/`drop`/`natSub`/
  `list_eq`/`list_compare`) + `compareChar`, as elaborated on
  `wp/L3-strings-surface`.
- expect: each **producer-greps** in `crates/ken-elaborator/src` as a
  `declare_recursive_group` / `declare_def` member whose `match` on the
  recursive argument lowers to the **real generic `Term::Elim { fam }`** over
  the `List`/`Nat` family (`34 §3`) — **not** a bespoke reducer, and **not** a
  registered `elim_List`/`elim_Nat` **constant** (there is none; `§4.1`).
  `OrdResult` greps as a **checked inductive** (`data OrdResult = Lt | Eq | Gt`,
  kernel-admitted by positivity) — **not** a
  `declare_primitive`/`declare_postulate`/`declare_opaque`.
  `git diff origin/main -- crates/ken-kernel/` is **empty**; `trusted_base()`
  unchanged.
- why: DS-AC1/AC5 — the floor is real derived surface at **zero-TCB-delta**.
  **Producer-grep, not hand-fed:** the combinators are **net-new**
  (grep-verified absent at `f50be22`), so a green must observe the **real**
  registration, not a synthetic def (the
  `conformance-hand-feeds-the-deliverable` net). A bug adding a native prim for
  a combinator (growing `trusted_base()`) or declaring `OrdResult` as a
  postulate is caught by the empty-kernel-diff + no-new-trusted-decl grep.
  (structural; producer-grep; zero-delta.)

### surface/collections/list-floor-recursion-in-sct-sound-zone (soundness)
- spec: `37 §4.1` (mandated defining equations), `17 §4` (SCT),
  `ken-kernel/src/sct.rs`
- given: the 7 floor combinators' mandated defining equations (`37 §4.1`).
- expect: for **each**, the recursive call is an **applied** call whose
  decreasing argument is a **strict subterm** of a matched argument — the `Cons`
  tail (`list_append`/`nth`/`take`/`drop`/`list_eq`/`list_compare`) or the `Suc`
  predecessor (`nth`/`take`/`drop`/`natSub`) — so the SCT **accepts** (real-now:
  every shape SCT-passes via the landed `map`/`zip`/`unfoldUpTo`/`insert`/
  `natSub` precedents, `l3a_acceptance.rs` + `val1_string_literals.rs`).
  **Discriminator:** a sibling recursing on a **non-subterm** — the whole
  matched argument reconstructed, `bad (Cons x xs) = bad (Cons x xs)`, an
  **applied** call carrying **no** `Down` argument — is **rejected** (SCT
  requires an applied call with a `Down` argument; `§4.1`, `sct.rs`).
- why: DS-AC2 (Architect brief-condition 1). **(soundness)** — a disguised
  non-terminator admitted by SCT inhabits `Bottom` via a δ-loop. The floor stays
  in the SCT **sound zone** and does **not** lean on the SCT **over-accept**
  zone (`sct-unapplied-self-reference-over-accepts`: a bare *unapplied*
  self-`Const` / recursion-through-an-opaque-`Map` — `c := c`, `loop := id loop`
  — is transparently edge-free and mis-admitted; none of the 7 need that shape).
  The accept/reject **verdict-flip** on the applied-subterm vs
  reconstructed-non-subterm pair is the guard; the SCT accept/reject
  **mechanism** is kernel-homed (`../../kernel/seed-kernel.md`), referenced not
  re-pinned. (soundness; sound-zone; applied-subterm verdict-flip.)

### surface/strings/derived-string-ops-reduce-over-real-roundtrip
- spec: `37 §2.5` (mandated bodies), `37 §2.3` (real `s2l`/`l2s`)
- given: `concat`/`slice`/`charAt` applied to a multi-byte corpus through the
  real `s2l`/`l2s` (reuse slice-1's boundary corpus: ASCII + `é`/CJK/emoji, plus
  empty).
- expect: reduce to the **correct value** — `concat "ab" "cd" ≡ "abcd"`, and
  `concat` over a multi-byte pair preserves every scalar;
  `slice 1 3 "abcde" ≡ "bc"`; `slice` **clamps** — `slice 0 99 "abc" ≡ "abc"`
  (over-range `take` stops at the end) and `slice 2 1 "abc" ≡ ""`
  (`natSub 1 2 ≡ 0` → `take 0 ≡ Nil`, no underflow); `charAt` is `Option Char` —
  `charAt 1 "abc" ≡ Some 'b'`, `charAt 5 "abc" ≡ None`, `charAt 0 "" ≡ None`.
  Indices are **code-point** positions (over the `List Char` view), never byte
  offsets. Assert the reduced **values**.
- why: DS-AC3 — the 5 ops compute correctly through the real round-trip.
  **Reduces-to on real producers:** the ops run through the landed `s2l`/`l2s`
  (wired via `store.list_char_ids` in test setup, as slice 1), not a hand-fed
  `List Char`. `charAt`'s `Option` (honest absence, `34 §1`, not a sentinel) and
  `slice`'s saturating clamp (`natSub`, never underflow) are the totality faces;
  a byte-offset `slice` (splitting a multi-byte scalar) or a partial `charAt`
  (stuck/sentinel out of range) is caught by the multi-byte + out-of-range
  witnesses. (reduces-to; totality; real round-trip.)

### surface/strings/string-eq-codepoint-wise-accept-reject-pair
- spec: `37 §2.5` (`eq` codepoint-wise), ADR 0010 §2, COORDINATION §7
- given: `eq : String → String → Bool` on (a) two **equal** scalar sequences,
  (b) a **same-length, single-codepoint-differing** pair, (c) a **length-
  differing** pair.
- expect: **the verdict flips** — (a) `eq "abc" "abc" ≡ True`; (b)
  `eq "abc" "abd" ≡ False` (same length, one codepoint differs — `list_eq`
  short-circuits on the first mismatch); (c) `eq "ab" "abc" ≡ False` (`Nil` vs
  `Cons` at position 2). Assert the **result value** (`True`/`False`), not "it
  type-checks".
- why: DS-AC4 accept+reject face — a **non-degenerate pair** (COORDINATION §7),
  not a single accept. A single `eq _ _ ≡ True` case is green-vs-green under an
  `eq` that ignores its second argument (or always returns `True`); the same-
  length single-differ reject (b) is the tightest guard — a length-only equality
  would pass (a)+(c) yet **fail** (b). `eq` rides the landed `eqChar`
  (`= eq_int` under `Char`'s `Int` erasure). (verdict-flip pair; result-value.)

### surface/strings/string-compare-3way-lexicographic-triple
- spec: `37 §2.5.1` (`compare` 3-way over `OrdResult`), ADR 0010
- given: `compare : String → String → OrdResult` on the ordered triple `"a"`,
  `"ab"`, `"b"`, and a reflexive input.
- expect: `compare "a" "ab" ≡ Lt` (`'a' ≡ 'a'`, then `Nil` vs `Cons` → shorter-
  prefix `Lt`); `compare "ab" "b" ≡ Lt` (`compareChar 'a' 'b' ≡ Lt`, since
  `leqChar 97 98` and `'a' ≠ 'b'`); `compare "b" "a" ≡ Gt`;
  `compare "ab" "ab" ≡ Eq`. Assert the **`OrdResult`** value `Lt`/`Eq`/`Gt` —
  **not** an `Ordering` (no such type on `main`) and **not** a `Bool`.
- why: DS-AC4 order face — the 3-way lexicographic order `"a" < "ab" < "b"` at
  the spec's **locked granularity** (`OrdResult`, not the frame's non-existent
  `Ordering`; `Ord Char` is `leq`-only, `lawful_classes.ken:359`). `compareChar`
  **repackages** the landed `leqChar`/`eqChar` (a faithful 3-way of the landed
  total order; a `declare_def`, so a bug is a wrong value, never a false proof).
  The prefix rule (`Nil` vs `Cons` → `Lt`) is what orders `"a" < "ab"`; a
  `compare` returning `Bool` or dropping the prefix rule is caught.
  (verdict-flip triple; `OrdResult` granularity.)

### surface/strings/list-eq-is-codepoint-wise-not-nfc-folding (property)
- spec: `37 §2.5` (codepoint-wise; NFC-normalization equality OUT), ADR 0010 §3
- given: `list_eq eqChar` on two **canonically-equivalent but
  codepoint-distinct** scalar sequences, constructed **directly** as `List Char`
  literals — `cs_nfc = [Char U+00E9]` (precomposed "é", one scalar) and
  `cs_nfd = [Char U+0065, Char U+0301]` ("e" + combining acute, two scalars).
- expect: `list_eq eqChar cs_nfc cs_nfd ≡ False` — the two scalar **sequences**
  differ (length 1 vs 2), so codepoint-wise equality is **False**, regardless of
  their NFC canonical equivalence. `list_eq`/`eq` **never** folds NFC-
  normalization into the comparison.
- why: DS-AC4 NFC-absence face (ADR 0010 §3) — pins that NFC-normalization
  equality was **not smuggled** into `eq`. **Constructed at the `List Char`
  layer on purpose:** the pin is **unconditional** there (two distinct scalar
  sequences are always codepoint-unequal), whereas at the `String`-literal layer
  it would depend on whether NFC-at-construction is real vs stubbed — pinning
  `eq "é" "e◌́" ≡ False` on **literals** would falsely fail once real NFC lands
  and merges them at construction (the over-pinning-a-deferred-behavior trap). A
  `list_eq` that NFC-normalized before comparing would return `True` here — the
  discriminating flip. **This is why an NFC equality is not deliverable as a
  lawful `DecEq`** (it identifies distinct sequences → non-canonical → would
  inhabit `Bottom`, ADR 0010 §3); the codepoint-wise `eq` is canonical over the
  `List Char` carrier and sound. **Reconciliation with
  `string-nfc-canonically-equal` (oracle):** that is a **different operation at
  a different layer** — extensional `String` `==` on two NFC-equivalent
  **literals** that NFC-at-construction normalizes to one scalar sequence
  (→ `==` `True`, when real NFC lands); **this** case is
  the derived codepoint-wise `list_eq`/`eq` on two genuinely-distinct **scalar
  sequences** (which `String` construction never yields as distinct values). No
  overlapping-input contradiction: `==` decides post-normalization extensional
  equality; `eq`/`list_eq` decides **scalar-sequence** equality
  (NFC-blind); under real NFC they **agree** on `String` values. (property;
  NFC-blind; layer reconciliation.)

### surface/collections/list-append-does-not-shadow-bytes-append
- spec: `37 §4.1` (name hygiene, Architect brief-condition 2)
- given: `list_append : {a} → List a → List a → List a` and the landed
  `Bytes`-domain `append : Bytes → Bytes → Bytes` (FS-effect, `bytes.rs`).
- expect: `list_append` resolves to the **List** op (pure,
  `List a → List a → List a`) and **not** the `Bytes` `append` (`visits [FS]`,
  `bytes.rs:144`); both names resolve to their **intended** op, and a
  `list_append` application on `List a` does **not** pick up the `[FS]` effect
  row.
- why: DS-AC6 (Architect brief-condition 2). The `Bytes` `append` is **landed**
  (grep-verified: `bytes.rs:144`, `declare_primitive`
  `PrimReduction::Op{symbol:"append"}`, `[FS]` row) — a `list_append` that
  **shadowed** it would mis-resolve the `List` op to the `Bytes` primitive (type
  error / wrong reduction) or leak an `[FS]` effect onto pure list
  concatenation. Producer-grep the **distinct** registration. The other floor
  names (`nth`/`take`/`drop`/`natSub`/`list_eq`/`list_compare`) are free
  (grep-verified — only lexical false-positives). (name hygiene;
  distinct-registration.)

### surface/strings/concat-slice-compose-and-floor-totality
- spec: `37 §4.1` (totality), `37 §2.5` (`concat`/`slice` compose), `18a §3`
  (defining-law oracle)
- given: `concat`/`slice`/`list_append` on a small scalar-clean corpus.
- expect: interpreter evaluation of
  `slice 0 (char_length a) (concat a b)` returns `a` for scalar-clean `a` (the
  length-`char_length a` prefix of `concat a b` is `a`); `list_append` is
  **associative** on a small corpus
  (`list_append (list_append xs ys) zs ≡ list_append xs (list_append ys zs)`);
  every combinator is **total** — `natSub` saturates at `0`, `nth`/`take`/`drop`
  totalize out-of-range to `None`/`Nil`, and **no** well-typed application
  reduces to `Neutral`/stuck. Assert the runtime values + non-`Neutral`; do not
  reinterpret the `char_length` runtime result as kernel conversion evidence.
- why: DS-AC7 — compositional sanity + totality. The `concat`/`slice` round-trip
  is a **defining-law oracle** (`18a §3`-style — non-circular, cannot alias the
  reduction it audits), exercising the ops end-to-end; `list_append`
  associativity is the canonical structural law; totality closes the "no stuck
  on well-typed input" face. A `slice`/`natSub` underflow (partial) or a
  `Neutral`-producing combinator is caught. (reduces-to; law; totality.)

- **AC7** (user-type instance search, L3b — the §6 gate crossing):
  the former `user-deceq-instance-keys-map-via-real-search` and
  `user-deceq-keyed-map-canonical-identity` are retained supersession controls
  with no active `given`/`expect`. **Deferred (lawful-`Ord`-class WP):**
  `user-ord-instance-drives-verified-sort`,
  `user-ord-sort-emits-both-conjuncts` (soundness).
- **DS-AC1–7** (derived string surface, slice 2 — the `List Char` floor + 5
  string ops):
  `list-combinator-floor-derived-over-real-elim` (DS-AC1/AC5),
  `list-floor-recursion-in-sct-sound-zone` (DS-AC2, soundness),
  `derived-string-ops-reduce-over-real-roundtrip` (DS-AC3),
  `string-eq-codepoint-wise-accept-reject-pair` +
  `string-compare-3way-lexicographic-triple` +
  `list-eq-is-codepoint-wise-not-nfc-folding` (DS-AC4),
  `list-append-does-not-shadow-bytes-append` (DS-AC6),
  `concat-slice-compose-and-floor-totality` (DS-AC7).

## Cross-case consistency sweep

- **Extensional equality is one story across every collection (`41 §4`).**
  `string-nfc-canonically-equal`,
  `array-update-preserves-unchanged-values`, and
  `structurally-equal-collections-compare-equal` agree: equality never depends
  on a pointer, slot, allocation path, insertion order, or construction
  history. Copying and structural sharing are both permitted.
- **Derived string `eq`/`compare` are codepoint-wise functions that agree with
  extensional `==` in result.** The slice-2
  `eq`/`compare`/`list_eq` (`string-eq-codepoint-wise-accept-reject-pair`,
  `string-compare-3way-lexicographic-triple`,
  `list-eq-is-codepoint-wise-not-nfc-folding`) decide **scalar-sequence**
  equality/order over the `List Char` view. On well-formed `String` values they
  **agree** in result with `==` (both decide the NFC-normalized scalar
  sequence). The
  NFC-vs-NFD pin (`list-eq-…-not-nfc-folding`) lives at the `List Char` layer,
  where distinct scalar sequences are **unconditionally** unequal — it does
  **not** contradict `string-nfc-canonically-equal` (oracle), which is `==` on
  NFC-equivalent literals normalized at construction. A case asserting the
  derived `eq` folds NFC-equivalence would contradict this split.
- **The proved `Map`/`Set` keying story is `Ord`, not storage identity.**
  The former `DecEq`-keyed cases are marked superseded and are not live
  producers. The active `stdlib/map` corpus compares ordered extensional
  contents and admits no byte-order, pointer, slot, or interning identity.
- **Infinitude is inductive on both faces.** `no-coinductive-construct-…`
  (absence of a coinductive former) and `fuel-bounded-unfold-…` (presence of an
  inductive producer) are duals of the §1 decision: every way to "stream" is an
  inductive idiom (fuel-unfold / `Lazy`-thunk / generator / seam), **none** a
  coinductive value. A case introducing a `Stream` **kernel** type would
  contradict both.
- **Obligation cases observe emission, not type-checking.** `functor-law-…`,
  `map-lookup-insert-law-…`, and `sort-emits-…` are one class: each asserts a
  **real emitted obligation** to the `22` pipeline (and `sort` its
  **completeness** — both conjuncts). None may degrade to "it type-checks",
  which passes vacuously when no obligation is emitted (the untrusted-layer
  omission hole).
- **The user-instance path (AC7) does not revive the retired Map carrier.**
  Both old `DecEq`-keyed Map rows remain only as explicit supersession
  controls. The **`Ord` sort-VC leg**
  (`user-ord-sort-emits-both-conjuncts` ≡
  `sort-emits-issorted-and-perm`, both conjuncts on the user path) is
  **deferred** with the lawful-`Ord`-class WP — there is no user-`Ord` `sort`
  path on `main` to agree with the base, so `sort-emits-issorted-and-perm` (the
  explicit-comparator form) is the **sole live** emission-completeness home.

## Subsumed / not-duplicated (one home per property)

- **`String ↔ Bytes` (the partial `Bytes → String` decode) + the round-trip
  law** are **L6's** (`../bytes-io/seed-bytes-io.md`:
  `text-from-bytes-requires-named-decode`, `decode-encode-roundtrip-provable`,
  `reverse-roundtrip-is-not-a-law`). L3 references them for the `String ↔ Bytes`
  totalities; it does **not** re-pin the decode boundary or the round-trip.
- **`data`/`match`/`elim_List`, indexed families, per-branch refinement, and the
  refinement-types carrier** are **L2's** (`../data-match/seed-data-match.md`).
  L3 drives `elim_List` (AC2) and the `34 §5` refinement (AC6) but does **not**
  re-pin the L2 machinery.
- **`Char` (scalar, surrogate exclusion) and numeric literals** are **L1's**
  (`../numbers/seed-numbers.md`). L3 references `Char` (`35 §2.4`) for the
  `List Char` view, not re-pinned.
- **Durable canonical bytes, extensional equality, and resource profiles** are
  the runtime's (`../../runtime/seed-runtime.md`,
  `../../runtime/capacity/`). L3 observes value behavior; storage is private.
- **`Lazy` force/memo, generators, the behavioral seam** are **deferred /
  other-WP** (`42 §2` G1 / L5 / `70-behavioral/`). L3 pins only the **fuel-
  bounded unfold** (item 1) as buildable-now; the other three idioms are named
  in `37 §5` but not the mandated demo.

## Build-sequencing note

L3 builds on **landed** substrate: the `String` **primitive** (`14 §5`,
registered for L6 in `ken-elaborator/src/bytes.rs`), `List`/`Option`/`Result`
**L2 `data`** + `elim_List` (`34`), the runtime value model's canonical bytes
and extensional equality (`41 §2`/`§4`), the **`L-resolver-globals`**
cross-declaration
fallback (`c3a3f1d`), and the **strict-positivity + SCT** admission gates
(`14 §8`/`17 §4`). The cases that ride **only** landed machinery are real now:
`list-pattern-matches-via-real-elim`, the resolution face of `functor-law-…`,
`structurally-equal-collections-compare-equal` (the `List` half),
`fuel-bounded-unfold-…`, and `no-coinductive-construct-…` (the kernel is clean
today).

The build-half **Team Language** delivers is **net-new**: the `String` byte/char
ops + the four conversions; `Array` (durable kind `0x06`) with persistent
`set`; the proved package `Map`/`Set` with `insert`/`lookup`; the
`map`/`filter`/`fold`/`zip` combinators + their laws; instance resolution; and
the verified `sort`. So the QA gate (new-surface WP)
**producer-greps** the `String`/`Array`/`Map`/`Set` **registration** in
`ken-elaborator/src/` (and the `String` primitive in the kernel set, `18 §5`)
**before** counting green; the laws + `sort` must route through **real `22`
obligation emission**, lawful Map keying through **real** constraint
resolution, and Array persistence through the **real** `set` — **no** synthetic
literal or hand-fed obligation where a real elaboration is asserted
(the `conformance-hand-feeds-the-deliverable` net). The **NFC-equality** case is
`(oracle)`-staged until real NFC normalization lands
(`content-addressing.md §1.4` K3 note); **user-type** `DecEq`/`Ord` instancing
is covered by the class corpus after Lc `4aa36c7`; the former `DecEq`-keyed Map
vehicle is superseded here. The NFC half stays `(oracle)`; the live cases are
normative.

Primitive-`Op` conversion is a separate staging axis: runtime value cases for
`byte_length`/`char_length` are live, while the `Refl` proof case remains
DEFERRED/RED-UNTIL-K3 unless and until K3 makes those exact operations reduce in
kernel conversion.
