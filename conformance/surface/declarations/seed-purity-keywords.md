# SURF-1 (purity keywords `const`/`fn`/`proc`) conformance — seed cases

Format: `../../README.md`. These pin the **purity-keyword discipline** that
**SURF-1** delivers (`docs/program/wp/purity-keywords-effect-polymorphism.md`,
`spec/30-surface/33-declarations.md §1`, `spec/30-surface/36-effects.md`): the
single definition keyword `view` is retired for a **three-keyword split that
agrees, by a checked bidirectional rule, with a definition's static purity and
arity** —

- **`const`** — a **zero-param pure** value (`33 §1`'s pure `let`/nullary
  value);
- **`fn`** — a **pure function with ≥1 parameter** (statically, unconditionally
  pure — effect row is the **closed empty set `∅`**, no row variable);
- **`proc`** — **anything at least potentially impure/imperative** at any arity
  (a concrete non-empty row, an effect-polymorphic row *variable*, or a `space`
  op).

The keyword is a **reliable signal**: reading `fn` guarantees "unconditionally
pure mathematical function"; `proc` warns "at least potentially impure." Purity
is a **checked declaration at the definition site**, not a convention. These
cases pin the **non-row-polymorphic** slice (AC1/AC1a/AC4/AC5/AC6/AC7, PK1–PK7)
**and** the **row-polymorphic** slice (AC2/AC3, PK8–PK9), **reconciled against
spec-author's landed spec** (`36 §1.5`/`§1.6`, `31 §1c`/`§4`, `32 §1`/`§8`, `33
§1` @ `c74a469`) — the reconcile un-oracled the two §5 sub-decisions and
resolved both flags (see below).

**Trust posture.** The keyword split is a **surface grammar + elaborator +
effect-checker** discipline; effects are **outer-ring** (`36 §2`, `OQ-8`
DECIDED) and the **kernel is untouched** (frame AC5) — it re-checks only the
pure denotation (`ITree`/Π/Σ/inductive), which is keyword-agnostic. So a bug in
the purity check **cannot make the kernel unsound** (the emitted core term is
still a well-typed pure tree); **no case here is `(soundness)`** in the
kernel-trust-root sense. What the discipline *does* guarantee is a **static
reliable-signal property** the verification core (`../../20-verification/`) and
downstream readers rest on: a **`fn`/`const` cannot silently perform an
effect**, and its dual, a **`proc` cannot silently over-claim impurity**. Both
directions are load-bearing (`33 §1`, `36 §1.6.2` "the keyword cannot lie"), so
each is pinned by a **discriminating** case whose verdict **flips** on the
targeted bug (right keyword accepts, wrong keyword rejects), holding the **body
fixed** so the flip is attributable to the keyword alone — never green-vs-green
(`discriminating-conformance-verdict-must-flip`, COORDINATION §7).

**Build-FORCING — the whole split is RED on `main` until built (do NOT hand-feed
green).** The **spec** for the split is now landed (spec-author's
`36 §1.5`/`§1.6`,
`32 §1`/`§8`, `33 §1`, `31 §1c`/`§4` @ `c74a469`, reconciled below); what is
**not** built is the **D2 elaborator + bidirectional purity checker** and the D4
migration. At `origin/main @ 24a414b` the surface keyword is still `view` and no
parser/checker enforces `const`/`fn`/`proc`. So **every keyword case flips green
only when the D2 build lands** — authored as the acceptance *target*, like
`../effects/seed-effects.md`'s EFF6 direct-state cases, **not** green against a
pre-supplied verdict ([[conformance-hand-feeds-the-deliverable]]). The case
**defines "done."**

**Tags.** `(oracle)` — confirmed at build time by the Spec enclave (safe: not in
the kernel TCB). The **keyword spellings `const`/`fn`/`proc` are FIXED**
(operator
ruling, `36 §1.6` — do **not** oracle-tag or propose alternates) and the
**classification rule** (static purity + arity, `36 §1.6.1`–`§1.6.3`) is
**normative**; what stays `(oracle)` is the surrounding **effect surface
*spelling*** (`visits ρ`, `perform`, effect names `FS`/`Console`/`Clock`,
`becomes`, `old`/`ensures`, the `[e]`/`[E | e]` glyphs — `36` is
normative-for-model, `OQ-syntax` for spelling). **The two enclave sub-decisions
are now un-oracled at the `c74a469` reconcile:** mismatch severity =
**hard error** (`§1.6.3(a)`) and `const` counts **explicit value params only**
(`§1.6.3(b)`, so `const nil {A}` is a `const`). `(property)` — an invariant over
many inputs / a structural (TCB-surface, migration) assertion, not a single
trace. **Every case here is also build-forcing** (red until D2 lands); not
repeated per header.

**Row-polymorphic slice — reconciled against the landed `36 §1.5` (AC2/AC3,
PK8–PK9).** Architect's D1 ruling (`evt_53ybqtzjfv7yx`) and spec-author's
transcription (`36 §1.5` @ `c74a469`) pin the **row variable** as a bare row
`[e]` (`e` an implicit param, `39 §2.2`) with an optional open-row tail
`[E | e]`
(the row join `⟦E⟧ ∪ ⟦e⟧`, `§1.5.1`), **required in the declared type**
(`§1.5.2`,
§3.1: effects recoverable from the type). PK8/PK9 are reconciled against `§1.5`
character-for-substance — the `[e]`/`[E | e]` **glyph stays `(oracle)`** (both
the
latent-arrow `→[e]` and monadic `Eff [e] b` spellings are co-equal, `§1.5.1`),
but the **structure** (variable-in-the-type `§1.5.2`, static closure `§1.5.3`,
no
`Cap e` `§1.5.4`, the fixpoint-lift + fail-closed residual `§1.5.5`) is
normative.
`traverse` is the first surface consumer and **gates CAT-2/Traversable**.

**Flags to spec-author — both RESOLVED at the `c74a469` reconcile** (kept for
the
audit trail; independent-checker catches, not silently resolved).

1. **`const` keyword ↔ def-name collision — RESOLVED (renamed `konst`).** The
   current K combinator is `fn konst (A) (B) (x) (y) : A = x`; this replaces the
   former `view const` spelling (`32 §8`, `33 §1`: `const` is now a keyword),
   and
   the spec asserts "no `.ken` in the corpus names a def `const`/`fn`/`proc`."
   PK6 keeps the grep guard (no `const`-named def survives migration).
2. **proc-must-earn-impurity vs over-declaration seam — RESOLVED (`36 §1.6.2`,
   accept).** I flagged a `proc` that **declares** a non-empty row as headroom
   but
   whose **body infers `∅`** (PK2b) as `(oracle)` — legit `proc` or
   should-be-`fn`?
   `§1.6.2` rules it a **legitimate `proc`** (accept): classification keys on
   the
   **declared** row `ρ_decl` (`§1.6.1`), and declaring more than you use is the
   `§1.4` headroom rule. Only the **empty-declared** case (PK2a) is the
   hard-error
   mismatch. This **corrects** the assembly-thread hypothesis that `§1.6.3(a)`'s
   hard-error covers PK2b — the `§1.6.2` carve-out makes the over-declared case
   honest (see PK2b for the reconciled reading).

**Citations.** `33-declarations.md §1` (`const`/`fn`/`proc` → Π/λ; generic
implicit params; `const` replaces the former nullary value definition; local
`let` remains an expression), `§6` (operators = ordinary defs, symbolic names);
`36-effects.md §1.1` (row lattice, latent arrow `A →[ρ] B`, pure row `∅`),
`§1.2` (transitive `infer_row`: `perform_E → {E}`, `g → row(g)`), `§1.4`
(declared-row `⊆` check, escape error + witness; "no `visits` ⇒ `ρ_decl = ∅`"),
`§2.4` (denotation `⟦·⟧`, pure collapse `ITree 𝟘 R ≅ R`), `§4.1`
(`space`/`becomes` → `State S`, one label per space), `§4.3` (bounded Hoare,
`old` scoped to the op), `§6` (a row-`∅` def is a mathematical function;
`ensures` value-level); `31-lexical §4` (keywords stay ASCII — Unicode is for
**operators**), `32-grammar §1` (`decl` production,
`effects ::= "visits" [ … ]`). Cross: `12 §2`/`§3` (predicative, non-cumulative
levels), frame §2 (fixed classification rule), §4 (acceptance), §5 (bounded
enclave sub-decisions).

Companion: this seed is **additive** over `../effects/seed-effects.md` (which
pins row inference/escape independently of the prior single-keyword definition
form) — SURF-1 layers
the **keyword↔(arity, purity)** contract on top.

## PK1 — `fn` is a reliable purity signal, forward direction (frame AC1)

A `fn` asserts the **closed-empty row `∅`** (`33 §1`: unconditionally pure). The
check runs the **body direction** (`36 §1.6.2`): if `infer_row(body) ⊄ ∅` — the
body performs or transitively infers **any** effect — the purity claim is false
and it is a **compile error**. Pinned **per effect source** (frame AC1: direct
`perform`, a called `proc`, a `space` op), each as a **two-arm** net: the
**identical body** under `proc` (with the matching declared row) **accepts**, so
the `fn` rejection is attributable to the keyword, not the body.

### surface/declarations/fn-direct-perform-rejected (oracle)
- spec: `33 §1` (`fn` = closed-empty row), `36 §1.2` (`perform_E → {E}`), `§1.4`
  (escape), `36 §1.6.2`/AC1
- given: an effect producer `greet` where `greet s ⤳ perform (Write s)`
  (`Console`, `36 §2.2`). Two arms, **identical body** `= greet x`:
  (a) `proc announce (x : String) : Unit visits [Console] = greet x`;
  (b) `fn  announce (x : String) : Unit               = greet x`.
- expect: (a) **accepts** — `proc` + declared `[Console]` matches
  `infer_row = [Console]` (`36 §1.4`). (b) **rejects** — `fn` asserts `∅`, but
  `infer_row = [Console] ⊄ ∅`; a **false-purity** static error naming effect
  **`Console`** and a **witness** (the `greet x` call / its `perform`, `§1.4`).
  Assert the **specific** error variant
  (`assert-specific-error-variant-not-is-err`), not a bare `is_err()`.
- why: the **direct-`perform` source** of the forward check. Verdict **flips**
  on the keyword (proc accepts, fn rejects), body held fixed. The targeted bug —
  a checker that skips the body-direction purity obligation for `fn` (treats
  `fn` like the old row-agnostic `view`) — **accepts (b)** ⇒ no flip ⇒ guards
  nothing; the pair pins it. Disconfirming: `greet` is well-formed in **both**
  arms, so arm (b) cannot reject for an unrelated (out-of-scope) reason — the
  reject is attributable to the purity claim.

### surface/declarations/fn-calls-proc-rejected (oracle)
- spec: `33 §1`, `36 §1.2` (`g → row(g)`, transitive closure), `§1.4`, frame
  §2.3/AC1
- given: a landed `proc read_config (p : String) : Config visits [FS] = …` (a
  boundary op, `36 §1`). Two arms, **identical body** `= read_config "/x"`:
  (a) `proc load () : Config visits [FS] = read_config "/x"`;
  (b) `fn  load () : Config             = read_config "/x"`.
- expect: (a) **accepts** — `infer_row = [FS]` (the callee's latent row released
  at the call, `36 §1.2`), matches declared `[FS]`. (b) **rejects** — the effect
  reaches `fn`'s `∅` **transitively** (not a syntactic `perform` in `load`'s own
  body); false-purity error naming **`FS`** with the `read_config` call as
  witness.
- why: the **called-`proc` (transitive)** source — the effect enters through the
  **call graph**, not a local `perform`, catching a checker that only scans for
  a syntactic `perform` in the immediate body. Verdict flips on the keyword; the
  `proc` accept-arm is the flip. Mechanism-consistent with the direct case (same
  "fn's `∅` must contain `ρ_inf`"), differing only in the effect's **source**.
  (`load` is nullary + effectful — a **`proc`**, not a `const`; see PK3.)

### surface/declarations/fn-space-op-rejected (oracle)
- spec: `33 §1`, `36 §4.1` (`space`/`becomes` → `State S`, one label per space),
  `§1.4`, `36 §1.6.1` (a `space` op is `proc`), AC1
- given: a `space Counter { mut n : Int = 0 ; … }`; the increment op with
  **identical body** `= n becomes n + 1`:
  (a) `proc inc () : Unit visits [Counter] = n becomes n + 1`;
  (b) `fn  inc () : Unit                   = n becomes n + 1`.
- expect: (a) **accepts** — `becomes` desugars to `Get`-then-`Put` on the
  space's `State S` (`36 §4.1`), contributing the space label `[Counter]`,
  matched by the declared row. (b) **rejects** — a `space` op is impure by
  construction (`36 §1.6.1`: a `space`/imperative op is decisively `proc`); `fn`
  cannot carry `[Counter]`. (`becomes` outside a `space` is a separate `§7.3.4`
  error — here both arms are **inside** `Counter`, isolating the keyword.)
- why: the **`space`-op source** — the third distinct way impurity enters, and
  the one that is imperative rather than a `perform`/call. Frame §2.1 puts a
  `space` op **decisively** on the `proc` side; this pins that a `fn` can never
  host one. Verdict flips on the keyword. Companion to EFF4
  `space-becomes-threads-state` (keyword-agnostic there).

---

## PK2 — `fn`/`proc` reliable signal, reverse direction (frame AC1, §2.3)

The signal is reliable only if it **cannot lie in either direction**: a `proc`
must **earn** its "potentially impure" claim. A definition with an **empty
declared row** that is **not** a `space` op is **provably pure** — it must be
`fn` (≥1 param) or `const` (zero param); a `proc` there is a **hard-error
mismatch** (`36 §1.6.2`, `§1.6.3(a)`). Classification keys on the **declared**
row `ρ_decl` (`§1.6.1`), so an **over-declared** `proc` (non-empty `ρ_decl`,
pure body) is **honest** — the `§1.4` headroom rule, not a mismatch (PK2b). This
is the piece EFF1 does **not** cover: EFF1's `⊆` check allows over-declaration
but never keys on the *keyword*.

### surface/declarations/proc-pure-should-be-fn (oracle)
- spec: `36 §1.6.2` (the reverse direction: a `proc` with empty declared row,
  not
  a `space` op, is provably pure ⇒ should-be-`fn`/`const`), `§1.6.3(a)`
  (mismatch = **hard error**, pinned), `§1.4`, `33 §1`
- given: a **pure** body, **no declared row**, ≥1 param, under two keywords:
  (a) `fn   add (x y : Int) : Int = x + y`;
  (b) `proc add (x y : Int) : Int = x + y`.
- expect: (a) **accepts** — `fn` + `ρ_decl = ∅` (whence `§1.4` forces `ρ_inf =
  ∅`) + ≥1 param (the required keyword for a pure ≥1-param def). (b) **rejects —
  hard error** (`§1.6.3(a)` pinned): `proc` claims potential impurity, but the
  declared row is **empty** and it is **not** a `space` op, so it is **provably
  pure** — a `proc`-should-be-`fn` mismatch. (Severity un-oracled: `§1.6.3(a)`
  pins hard error, not lint — a lint would leave the signal advisory.)
- why: the **reverse-direction** guard — the bidirectionality (`§1.6.2` "the
  keyword cannot lie"). The targeted bug — a checker that runs **only** the
  forward direction (PK1: `fn`-cannot-perform) but **not** the reverse
  (`proc`-must-earn-impurity) — **accepts (b) silently** ⇒ no flip ⇒ the reverse
  guard is vacuous. The pair pins that **both** directions are enforced. Verdict
  flips on the keyword, body held fixed. Distinct from the **over-declared**
  headroom case (PK2b) — there `ρ_decl` is non-empty, so `proc` is honest.

### surface/declarations/proc-overdeclared-headroom-accepted (oracle)
- spec: `36 §1.6.1` (classify on the **declared** row `ρ_decl`), `§1.6.2` (the
  explicit carve-out: a `proc` declaring a non-empty row whose body is now pure
  is **honest**, not a mismatch), `§1.4` (over-declaration `ρ_inf ⊆ ρ_decl`
  **allowed** — the headroom rule)
- given: a `proc` that **declares** a non-empty row as interface headroom but
  whose **body infers `∅`**:
  `proc stable (x : Int) : Int visits [Console] = x + 1` — never performs
  `Console`.
- expect: **accepts** (verdict now **settled by `§1.6.2`**, was `(oracle)`). The
  classification keys on the **declared** row (`§1.6.1`): `ρ_decl = [Console]` is
  **non-empty** ⇒ **Impure** ⇒ a **legitimate `proc`**. `§1.6.2` states it
  verbatim: a `proc` declaring `visits [FS]` with a now-pure body is honest —
  its
  declared row is non-empty, so declaring more than you use is the `§1.4`
  headroom rule (a stable interface). It is **not** the PK2a mismatch: that one
  has an **empty** declared row.
- why: **the flagged seam (flag 2), resolved by the reconcile.** I surfaced two
  coherent readings (legit-`proc` vs should-be-`fn`) as a `(oracle)` to
  spec-author rather than resolving it myself
  ([[surface-the-seam-need-not-your-preferred-mechanism]]); `§1.6.2` picked
  reading (i) **accept**, because classification is on `ρ_decl` not `ρ_inf`.
  Note:
  this **corrects** the assembly-thread hypothesis that `§1.6.3(a)`'s hard-error
  would make it a mismatch — the `§1.6.2` carve-out makes the **over-declared**
  case honest; only the **empty-declared** case (PK2a) is the hard error. The
  discriminating pair PK2a-vs-PK2b now pins `ρ_decl`-not-`ρ_inf` as the
  keyword's
  classification axis.

---

## PK3 — `const` vs `fn` by arity (frame AC1a)

Among **pure** definitions the keyword is keyed on **arity**: a **zero-param**
pure def **must** be `const` (referential transparency ⇒ it *is* a constant); a
**≥1-param** pure def **must** be `fn`. The wrong keyword is flagged.

### surface/declarations/const-zero-param-required (oracle)
- spec: `36 §1.6.1` (`const` = pure zero explicit-value-param; subsumes `let`),
  `§1.6.2` (arity mismatch), `§1.6.3(a)` (**hard error**, pinned), `33 §1`
- given: a **pure zero-param** value under two keywords:
  (a) `const answer : Int = 40 + 2`;
  (b) `fn    answer : Int = 40 + 2`.
- expect: (a) **accepts** — zero explicit value params + provably-`∅` row ⇒
  `const` (the required keyword). (b) **rejects — hard error** (`§1.6.3(a)`
  pinned, un-oracled): a zero-param `fn` is a should-be-`const` mismatch
  (`§1.6.2`; by referential transparency a nullary pure def always yields the
  same value, so it *is* a constant).
- why: the **zero-param end** of the arity split. Verdict flips on the keyword,
  body held fixed. The targeted bug — an arity-blind checker accepting any pure
  keyword — accepts **both** ⇒ no flip. Companion to PK3b (the ≥1-param end):
  the two ends make the `const`/`fn` boundary discriminating on arity both ways.

### surface/declarations/fn-one-param-required (oracle)
- spec: `36 §1.6.1` (`fn` = pure ≥1-param), `33 §1`, AC1a
- given: a **pure ≥1-param** function under two keywords:
  (a) `fn    triple (n : Int) : Int = n + n + n`;
  (b) `const triple (n : Int) : Int = n + n + n`.
- expect: (a) **accepts** — ≥1 explicit value param + provably-`∅` row ⇒ `fn`.
  (b) **rejects** — a `const` with a value parameter is not a zero-param value;
      a `const`-with-param arity error (a **hard** error, not a §5 lint —
      `const` is *defined* as zero-param, so a parameter is a category error at
      the keyword, independent of the §5 pure/impure severity choice).
- why: the **≥1-param end** of the arity split. Verdict flips on the keyword.
  Mechanism-consistent with PK3a: together they pin that among pure defs arity
  **exactly** selects `const` (0) vs `fn` (≥1) — a mis-selection either way is
  caught.

### surface/declarations/const-implicit-param-edge (oracle)
- spec: `36 §1.6.3(b)` (pinned: `const` counts **explicit value** params only;
  implicit `{…}` — type/level/instance/row — do **not** count), `39 §2.2`
  (implicits inserted+solved+erased at each use site), `33 §1`
- given: a polymorphic constant with an **implicit** type param and **no
  explicit value param**: `const nil {A : Type} : List A = Nil A`.
- expect: **accepts as a `const`** (verdict now **settled by `§1.6.3(b)`**, was
  `(oracle)`). `nil {A}` has **zero explicit value parameters**; the implicit
  `{A}` is inserted/solved/erased by the elaborator and never written by a
  caller
  (`39 §2.2`), so `nil` is used **exactly as a constant** — a polymorphic
  *constant family*, not a function. Forcing `fn` would misread "you apply this
  to a value" onto something no caller applies. The discriminating flip: a
  `fn nil {A : Type} : List A` (zero explicit value params) is the **rejected**
  arm (should-be-`const`, `§1.6.2`/`§1.6.3(a)`).
- why: the **implicit-param edge** the frame routed to spec-author (§5), now
  pinned. I authored it `(oracle)` on the concept rather than guessing
  ([[spec-exact-granularity]] T1 half); `§1.6.3(b)` resolved it to
  **implicit-params-don't-count** (`const` begins at the first explicit value
  param). Un-oracled to the settled verdict; the case now flips
  `const nil {A}` accept vs `fn nil {A}` reject.

## PK4 — `fn`'s effect-free guarantee, for verification (frame AC4)

A pure-typed `fn`/`const` (row `∅`) denotes to `ITree 𝟘 R ≅ R` — the elaborator
**collapses** it to the plain term (`36 §2.4`) — so the verification core may
treat it as a **mathematical function** whose `ensures` are **value-level**
(`36 §6`, restated for `fn`). A `proc` (impure) denotes to a real `Vis`-bearing
tree and its `ensures` may be **state-relative** (`old`, post-state, `36 §4.3`).
The keyword thus determines the verification treatment.

### surface/declarations/fn-pure-ensures-value-level (oracle)
- spec: `36 §2.4` (pure collapse), `§6` (row-`∅` def = mathematical function,
  value-level `ensures`), `33 §1`, frame AC4
- given: a pure `fn` with a value-level postcondition:
  `fn succ (n : Int) : Int ensures Equal Int result (n + 1) = n + 1`.
- expect: **accepts and the `ensures` discharges** — `succ` has row `∅`,
  collapses to the plain term (`ITree 𝟘 Int ≅ Int`, `§2.4`); the obligation
  `Equal Int result (n + 1)` is a **value** equation, discharged by
  computation/`refl`
  (`16 §2`), **no world-state**. The verification layer sees a mathematical
  function.
- why: AC4's **pure half** — the `∅`-row + collapse is the certificate the
  verification core rests on (mirrors EFF5 `pure-fn-usable-in-pure-context`,
  re-keyed on the new `fn` keyword). Pairs with PK4b for the flip.

### surface/declarations/fn-no-old-in-ensures (oracle)
- spec: `36 §4.3` (`old(e)` = `e` in the **pre-state**; well-defined only when
  the denotation *names* a pre-state), `§6`, frame AC4
- given: the **same** `old(n)`-style postcondition under two keywords:
  (a) `proc inc () : Unit visits [Counter]` with
      `ensures Equal Int n (old(n) + 1)` and body `n becomes n + 1` (inside
      `space Counter`);
  (b) `fn bump (n : Int) : Int` with
      `ensures Equal Int result (old(n) + 1)` and body `n + 1`.
- expect: (a) **accepts and discharges** — `old(n)` names the pre-state of the
  `space` op's `State S` transformer, obligation computes to `refl` (EFF4
  `space-old-scoped-to-ensures`, `36 §4.3`). (b) **rejects** — a pure `fn` has
  **no pre-state** to name, so `old(_)` in its `ensures` is a category error
  (`OldOutsideStatefulOp`, kind `(oracle)`).
- why: the discriminating face of AC4 — the keyword decides whether a
  **state-relative** postcondition (`old`) is even well-formed. Verdict
  **flips** on the keyword, postcondition held fixed: the `proc` space-op
  accepts it, the pure `fn` rejects it. A checker admitting `old` in a `fn` has
  lost the "pure ⇒ mathematical function" guarantee the verification core
  depends on.

---

## PK5 — kernel-untouched (frame AC5)

### surface/declarations/keywords-kernel-untouched (property)
- spec: `36 §2` (effects/rows are outer-ring; the kernel has no effect notion),
  `33 §1` (`const`/`fn`/`proc` all elaborate to Π/λ defs), frame AC5/§2.6
- given: the delivered `const`/`fn`/`proc` grammar + the bidirectional purity
  checker.
- expect: **`git diff origin/main -- crates/ken-kernel/` stays empty** and
  `trusted_base()` is **byte-unchanged** — **no new `Term`/`Decl` variant**, no
  new `declare_primitive`/`declare_postulate`. The split is entirely **surface
  parse + elaborator + effect-checker**; a `const`/`fn`/`proc` def elaborates to
  the **same** Π/λ core term the prior definition spelling did (the keyword is erased
  before the kernel), and a pure def still collapses to the plain term
  (`36 §2.4`). The purity **check** is an elaboration-time diagnostic
  (`36 §7.3`), never a kernel rule.
- why: frame AC5 is **structural**
  ([[tested-not-trusted-posture-needs-reachability-precondition]]: a
  producer-grepped build obligation, not a runtime assertion). If a build path
  ever needs a kernel `Term`/`Decl` variant for a keyword, **that is the
  finding** (the split has mis-scoped out of the outer ring). Asserts the
  **absence** of a kernel delta — no value-flip. (`property`.)

## PK6 — migration is green and complete (frame AC6)

### surface/declarations/migration-view-fully-retired (property)
- spec: frame D4/AC6 (`view` → `const`/`fn`/`proc`, classified by the checker's
  own inference), `31-lexical §4` (`view` leaves the reserved set)
- given: the migrated corpus — `prelude`, `catalog/packages/*` (incl. CAT-1's
  `lawful-classes`/`lawful-functors`), `examples/rosetta/*`, doc snippets.
- expect: (a) **no `.ken` retains `view`** —
  `grep -rn '\bview\b' packages prelude examples` (as a **decl head**) returns
  empty; every def carries `const`/`fn`/`proc` **as classified by the checker's
  own purity inference** (mechanical + checked, not hand-judged — frame D4). (b)
  `cargo test --workspace` **green**. (c) the **rosetta** corpus still passes
  **16/0** (frame AC6). (d) the `const`-combinator collision (flag 1) stays
  resolved — the V0 K combinator is `konst` (`32 §8`, `33 §1`); **no `.ken`
  names
  a def `const`/`fn`/`proc`**.
- why: AC6 — migration completeness as a **structural** check, not a per-file
  trace ([[two-arm-producer-needs-a-case-per-arm]]: the grep asserts the absence
  of a catch-all `view` remnant). Build-forcing: red until D4 lands; a
  **partial** migration (some `view` left, or a hand-misclassified `fn` that
  should be `proc`) fails (a) or (b). The checker-classified requirement is what
  makes it *checked*, not opinion.

## PK7 — Unicode surface parses identically (frame AC7, D3)

### surface/declarations/unicode-twin-identical (oracle)
- spec: `31 §1c` (BL3: lexer **accept-both** same-token + formatter emits
  canonical Unicode; ASCII stays accepted; **keywords stay ASCII**, principle
  4),
  `31 §4` (keyword table), `36 §2.4` (elaboration target), frame AC7
- given: a `.ken` module in **Unicode operator/symbol surface** and its
  **ASCII-digraph twin** (`->`/`→`, `\`/`λ`, `∀`, `Σ`, `Ω`, `⊑`) — **identical
  keywords** `const`/`fn`/`proc` in both (keywords are not Unicode-ified,
  `31 §1c`
  principle 4 / `31 §4`).
- expect: the Unicode twin and its ASCII twin **lex to the same token stream and
  elaborate to the byte-identical core term** (assert **term identity**, not
  merely "both elaborate"). The **accept-both policy is now pinned** (`31 §1c`,
  un-oracled): the lexer accepts **both** spellings as the same token (ASCII
  stays accepted), and the single formatter **normalizes to canonical Unicode on
  save** — not convert-only. The `(oracle)` residual is only the specific glyph
  table (proposal-level `OQ-syntax`), not the accept-both/formatter policy.
- why: AC7 — the Unicode surface is **notation over the same grammar**, so it
  must not change what elaborates. Asserting **core-term identity** (not a
  verdict) makes it a structural check no glyph choice can make vacuous. Grounds
  BL3 against `31 §1c` (keywords ASCII, operators Unicode, accept-both + emit).

## PK8 — `proc` covers the polymorphic case, on D1 (frame AC2)

**Reconciled against the landed `36 §1.5`** (spec-author's D1 transcription @
`c74a469`, from Architect's ruling `evt_53ybqtzjfv7yx`): the row variable is a
**bare row `[e]`** (`e` bound as an **implicit parameter**, like a type/level
param, `39 §2.2`; `§1.5.2`), optionally an **open-row tail `[E | e]`** (concrete
head + polymorphic tail = the row join `⟦E⟧ ∪ ⟦e⟧`, `§1.5.1`); the variable
**must appear in the declared type** (`§1.5.2`, §3.1 guarantee 1: effects
recoverable from the *type*). Both the latent-arrow `→[e]` and the monadic
`Eff [e] b` spellings are **co-equal** (`§1.5.1`). The `[e]`/`[E | e]` **glyph
stays `(oracle)`** (`OQ-syntax`); the **structure** (variable-in-the-type,
keyword `proc`, static closure) is **normative** from `§1.5`.

### surface/declarations/poly-def-is-proc-not-fn (oracle)
- spec: `36 §1.6.1` (`proc` ⟺ declared row contains a variable),
  `§1.5.1`/`§1.5.2`
  (row-variable surface + binding), `§1.6.2` (crux: effect-polymorphic ≠ pure)
- given: an effect-polymorphic definition whose declared type carries a **row
  variable** `e`. Two arms, **identical signature**, keyword varied:

  ```
  (a) proc traverse {a b} {e} (f : a -> Eff [e] b) (xs : List a)
        : Eff [e] (List b)  visits [e]
  (b) fn   traverse {a b} {e} (f : a -> Eff [e] b) (xs : List a)
        : Eff [e] (List b)  visits [e]
  ```
- expect: (a) **accepts** — the declared row **contains a variable** `e`, which
  is
  **decisively `proc`** (`§1.6.1`: Impure ⟺ `ρ_decl` non-empty **or contains a
  row variable** or is a `space` op). (b) **rejects** — `fn` asserts the
  **closed
  empty row, no row variable** (`§1.6.1` pure class); a row *variable* in the
  signature is not `∅`, a should-be-`proc` mismatch (hard error, `§1.6.3(a)`).
  Companion (`§1.5.2`): a body that **is** effect-polymorphic but whose
  signature
  **omits** the `[e]` is a **manifest-in-the-type violation**, reported like a
  `§1.4` escape — the surface variable is required, not optional.
- why: AC2's **core** — the polymorphic case lives **decisively on the `proc`
  side**, the crux that makes the binary split **total**. Verdict **flips** on
  the keyword with the signature held fixed. The targeted bug — a checker that
  reads a row-variable signature as pure (`Var(e)` mistaken for `∅`) — **accepts
  (b)** ⇒ no flip. Disconfirming: the signature is well-formed in both arms
  (same `traverse`), so (b) rejects for the keyword, not a signature error.
  **Gates CAT-2/Traversable** (`traverse` is the first surface consumer of D1).

### surface/declarations/proc-stays-proc-at-pure-instantiation (oracle)
- spec: D1 ruling (`apply_subst(e := ρ)`, `RowType`), `36 §1.2` (λ builds a
  closure, performs nothing; `traverse` never `perform`s `e` itself — splices
  the callback via `bind`), `§2.4`, `36 §1.6.2` (crux + do-not-optimize), AC2
- given: the accepted `proc traverse` (PK8a) **instantiated at a pure callback**
  `pure_f : a -> Eff [] b` — i.e. `e := ∅` by `apply_subst` (D1) — in the call
  `traverse pure_f xs`.
- expect: **dual assertion.** (i) the **call**
  `traverse pure_f xs : Eff [] (List b)` is **statically pure** —
  `apply_subst(e := ∅)` resolves the instantiated row to the **closed-empty**
  set; assert the instantiated call's row **= `∅`** (structural), effect-free,
  runs pure. (ii) **YET** the **definition** `traverse` stays **`proc`** — the
  keyword classifies the abstraction's **guarantee** (`36 §1.6.2`), not this
  best-case instantiation; `fn traverse` is **still rejected** (PK8a) even
  though *this* instantiation is pure.
- why: the **exact pure-instantiation round-trip** `36 §1.6.2`/AC2 demands + the
  do-not-reopen §6 guard ("do **not** 'optimize' a polymorphic definition into
  `fn` because it *can* be pure"). Two discriminating faces: (i) a checker that
  fails to `apply_subst(e := ∅)` leaves the call's row polymorphic/non-`∅` —
  caught by the asserted `∅`; (ii) a checker that "optimizes" the
  pure-instantiable poly def to `fn` **accepts `fn traverse`** — the exact bug
  §6 forbids, caught by the definition staying `proc`. Effect-polymorphic **≠**
  pure: the guarantee, not the instantiation, sets the keyword.

---

## PK9 — static closure at every instantiation, on D1 (frame AC3)

Every concrete instantiation of a row-polymorphic `proc` resolves to a
**statically-closed** effect set — the D1 ruling makes this **structural**: a
`RowVar` is eliminated only by `apply_subst(e := concrete)` at a call, and "you
cannot run a variable" (a boundary/handler sees a concrete row), so no effect is
discovered at runtime.

### surface/declarations/mis-declared-caller-row-rejected (oracle)
- spec: D1 ruling (`apply_subst` then the `§1.4` escape check on the resolved
  row), `36 §1.4` (escape), `36 §1.5.3`/AC3
- given: a caller of `traverse` (PK8a) supplying an **effectful** callback
  `log_f : a -> Eff [Console] b` — so `e := [Console]` by `apply_subst`. Two
  caller declarations, **identical body** `= traverse log_f xs`:
  (a) `proc run_all (xs : List a) : ... visits [Console] = traverse log_f xs`;
  (b) `proc run_all (xs : List a) : ... visits []       = traverse log_f xs`.
- expect: (a) **accepts** — the instantiated
  `traverse log_f xs : Eff [Console] (List b)`; the caller's declared
  `[Console]` contains it (`[Console] ⊆ [Console]`, `§1.4` after `apply_subst`).
  (b) **rejects statically** — the instantiated `[Console]` escapes the caller's
  declared `∅`; a **static** `EffectEscapes(Console)` (kind `(oracle)`), **not**
  a runtime discovery.
- why: AC3 — every concrete instantiation is **statically closed** (frame
  §2.3/AC3, D1: `apply_subst` resolves `e` to a concrete row at the call, then
  the ordinary `§1.4` escape check fires). Verdict **flips** on the caller's
  declared row, body fixed. The targeted bug — a checker that fails to propagate
  `e := [Console]` into the caller's escape check — **admits (b)** ⇒ runtime
  effect discovery ⇒ no flip; the pair pins "no runtime effect discovery."

### surface/declarations/open-row-straddle-rejects-valid (property, oracle)
- spec: D1 ruling + verified myself — `RowType::is_subset_of`'s single-arm
  rule `x ⊆ Join(l,r) = (x⊆l) || (x⊆r)`
  (`crates/ken-elaborator/src/effects/row.rs`, `is_subset_of` impl L200–202, doc
  L183–187; re-derived at authoring, not transcribed), `36 §1.4`
- given: an open-row tail `[E | e]` (`Join(Concrete({E}), Var(e))`) and a
  **concrete** row that **straddles both arms** — part in the concrete head `E`,
  part that must be absorbed by the variable tail: checking `{E, F} ⊆ [E | e]`
  (semantically valid with `e := {F}`).
- expect: **rejected** — the landed single-arm rule needs **all** of `{E, F}` in
  **one** arm: `{E,F} ⊆ {E}` is false and `{E,F} ⊆ Var(e)` is false, so the
  straddle is rejected. This is a **known-completeness marker**: it **rejects a
  VALID program** (fail-closed), and is **NOT a soundness flip** — the
  single-arm rule **never over-accepts** (no effect silently escapes); the
  residual is **rejected-valid**, never accepted-invalid (Architect's D1 note).
- why: pins the fail-closed residual as a **documented completeness limit**, not
  a soundness hole
  ([[kernel-rejects-is-completeness-fix-is-where-soundness-converts]]:
  over-rejection is fail-closed/safe; the soundness risk is only if a *fix*
  loosens `is_subset_of` to over-accept). A future build that **tightens** the
  rule to accept the straddle is a **completeness improvement** (must still
  never over-accept); a regression that makes it **over-accept** is the real
  bug. Not a verdict-flip discriminator — a **one-directional** structural
  marker asserting the rejection **and** its completeness-not-soundness
  classification, so the fix-vector is unambiguous. (`property`; the `row.rs`
  line anchors are perishable — reconcile against the landed impl at the build.)

## Regression — SURF-1 is additive over `view`/effects surface

### surface/declarations/additive-over-effects-seed (property)
- spec: `../effects/seed-effects.md` (EFF1 keyword-agnostic row
  inference/escape), `36 §2.4` (pure collapse), `36 §1.6.4` (`view` roles carry
  over)
- given: the EFF1 row-inference/escape invariants and the on-`main` surface
  corpus, after the `view` → `const`/`fn`/`proc` migration.
- expect: **unchanged behavior** — SURF-1 **renames and constrains** the
  definition keyword; it does **not** change row inference (`36 §1.2`), the
  escape check (`§1.4`), or pure-program elaboration. A former pure `view`
  becomes a `fn`/`const` and elaborates to the **identical** core term (`§2.4`);
  a former effectful `view` becomes a `proc` with the **same** inferred/declared
  row. The EFF1 cases (`eff-undeclared-escapes-rejected`,
  `eff-overdeclared-upper-bound-accepted`) still hold under the new keyword.
- why: SURF-1 is **additive** — it adds the keyword↔purity contract **over** the
  landed row machinery, not a replacement. Pins that introducing the split
  perturbs neither pure-program elaboration nor the effect-row discipline EFF1
  guards. (`property`: regression guard over the effects corpus + surface.)
