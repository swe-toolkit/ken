# LET-4 multi-binding `let` conformance seed

These cases pin the sequential local-binding group specified by
`docs/program/wp/let4-multi-binding-let.md` S1–S6. They extend the existing
single-binding roots in `seed-elaboration.md` and the existing effect-order root
in `../effects/seed-effects.md`; they do not duplicate those mechanisms.

**Status and reachability.** The one-binding and explicitly nested controls are
LIVE on the grounding base. Every source containing a grouped binding separator
is **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface)**: before the grouped grammar lands it cannot
produce the lossless/typed source consumed by resolution or formatting. Every
grouped formatter-byte assertion is therefore
**RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface + formatter)**. The build must rerun
`parse_lossless` over every noncanonical input and every canonical expected
block below before flipping either label.

The mandatory mechanical sweep on exact base `6d6504d6` produced:

| Layout case | Noncanonical input | Canonical expected block |
|---|---|---|
| D1 one binding | reaches | reaches |
| D2 short group | does not reach | does not reach |
| D3 long group | does not reach | does not reach |
| D4 compound match RHS | does not reach | does not reach |
| D5 group in match arm | does not reach | does not reach |
| D6 grouped comments | does not reach | does not reach |
| D7 nested-to-group | reaches | does not reach |
| D8 shadow segment | reaches | does not reach |
| D9 commented nested-to-group | reaches | does not reach |
| D10 literate body | does not reach | does not reach |

The sweep called the real `parse_lossless` on all twenty strings. This is why
D1 is live, why the D7–D9 inputs are live compatibility controls, and why every
grouped expected block names the surface precondition as well as the formatter.

Expected text in section D is derived from S6 and the general `31 §1d` physical
text, spacing, comment, match, and declaration productions. It is not sampled
from a formatter implementation. If the amended normative chapters admit a
second output for any fixture, this seed must stop for a spec correction rather
than choose between them.

## A. Grammar and separator boundaries

### surface/elaboration/let4-one-binding-compatibility-control (control)

- spec: S1; `32 §3`; `39 §5.2`–`§5.4`
- given: `const one : Nat = let value : Nat = Zero in value`
- expect: **LIVE — accepted** and lowered through the existing single local
  binding.
- why: the new list grammar has cardinality one as a compatibility case. A
  parser that requires a separator or two bindings regresses the existing
  surface.

### surface/elaboration/let4-two-binding-group-accepted

- spec: S1; `32 §3`; LET-4 AC1
- given: `const two : Nat = let first = Zero; second = Suc first in second`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface) — accepted** as exactly two bindings and
  one final body.
- why: this is the positive arm for the separator cases. The second occurrence
  of `first` also makes a parser that truncates the list at `;` observable at
  resolution.

### surface/elaboration/let4-explicit-nested-compatibility-control (control)

- spec: S1/S3; `32 §3`; `39 §5.3`–`§5.5`; LET-4 AC1
- given: `const two_nested : Nat = let first = Zero in let second = Suc first
  in second`
- expect: **LIVE — accepted** and lowered to the existing ordered two-node
  `Term::Let` nest.
- why: S6 changes this spelling's canonical output, not its acceptance or
  meaning. This live arm catches a parser or lowering change that accidentally
  removes the explicitly nested compatibility form.

### surface/elaboration/let4-separator-is-between-bindings

- spec: S1; `32 §3`; LET-4 AC1
- given: the accepted source above, compared with
  `let first = Zero; in first` and
  `let first = Zero, second = first in second`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface)** — the first malformed source rejects at
  `in` with a focused missing-binding-after-separator error; the second rejects
  at `,` as an invalid separator. Neither may recover by silently dropping a
  separator or inventing a binding.
- why: correct `;`-between/no-trailing accepts while the two one-token boundary
  changes reject. A permissive optional-trailing or comma-list grammar flips a
  negative arm.

### surface/elaboration/let4-match-rhs-semicolon-partition

- spec: S1; `32 §3` and the `match` arm grammar; LET-4 D0.3/AC1
- given:

  ```ken ignore
  fn chosen (input : Nat) : Nat =
    let first = match input { Zero ↦ Zero; Suc n ↦ n };
        second = Suc first
    in second
  ```

- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface) — accepted**. The semicolon inside
  `{ ... }` separates match arms; after the closing `}` the next semicolon
  separates `first` from `second`. The parser produces two let bindings, and
  `first`'s RHS is one complete two-arm match.
- why: braces put the parser in the arm-list state, while `let ... in` puts it
  in the binding-list state. A parser that treats both semicolons as members of
  one undifferentiated list changes the binding count or match-arm count.

### surface/elaboration/let4-grouped-let-is-one-match-arm-body

- spec: S1/S4; `32` match grammar; LET-4 D0.3/AC1/AC4
- given:

  ```ken ignore
  fn branch_value (flag : Bool) : Nat =
    match flag {
      True ↦ let first = Zero; second = Suc first in second;
      False ↦ Zero
    }
  ```

- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface) — accepted** with two match arms. The
  `;` between `first` and `second` is consumed by the let-binding list; the
  `;` after `second` is consumed only after the mandatory `in` has closed that
  list, so it separates the `True` and `False` arms.
- why: this is the inverse orientation of the preceding boundary. It would
  fail if a grouped let were hoisted out of its arm or if the binding separator
  prematurely ended the arm body.

### surface/elaboration/let4-nested-let-and-arrow-rhs-boundaries

- spec: S1/S3; `32 §3`; LET-4 D0.3/AC1
- given:

  ```ken ignore
  const nested_rhs : Nat =
    let first = let inner = Zero in inner;
        step : Nat → Nat = λn. Suc n;
        result = step first
    in result
  ```

- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface) — accepted** as three outer bindings.
  The inner `in inner` closes only the nested RHS; `Nat → Nat` remains one type
  annotation; the two outer semicolons remain binding separators.
- why: pins the other two delimiter-adjacent D0 forms without changing the
  surrounding group. A greedy RHS or arrow parser changes the outer binding
  count and fails the structural result.

---

## B. Sequential, nonrecursive scope

### surface/elaboration/let4-dependent-later-annotation-accepted

- spec: S2; `39 §5.3`–`§5.5`; LET-4 AC2
- given: `const dependent : Nat = let a : Type = Nat; x : a = Zero in x`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface) — accepted**. `a` resolves in the second
  annotation, and `x` has the elaborated type selected by the first binding.
- why: a simultaneous-scope or annotation-before-prior-bindings
  implementation rejects this valid dependent stage.

### surface/elaboration/let4-earlier-value-feeds-later-rhs-and-body

- spec: S2/S4; `34 §"Canonical non-dependent pair floor family"`; `39
  §5.3`–`§5.5`; LET-4 AC2
- given: using canonical floor `Pair` and `mk_pair` with no provider import,
  `const staged : Pair Nat Nat = let first = Zero; second = Suc first in
  mk_pair Nat Nat first second`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL both the Pair floor realization and LET-4 surface —
  accepted**; the later RHS resolves
  `first`, and the body resolves and consumes both `first` and `second`.
- why: together with the two negative cases below, this is a controlled
  left-to-right scope experiment rather than an elaborate-only green case.

### surface/elaboration/let4-self-reference-is-out-of-scope

- spec: S2; `39 §5.3`; LET-4 AC2
- given: `const self_bad : Nat = let self_group_probe : Nat =
  self_group_probe; ok = Zero in ok`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface) — rejected** with
  `UnresolvedCon { name = "self_group_probe" }` at the occurrence in the first
  RHS. A bare `is_err`, a later type error, or resolving the occurrence to its
  own binder does not satisfy this case.
- why: the binder is pushed only after its annotation and RHS resolve. The
  unique name prevents a global from making the negative vacuous.

### surface/elaboration/let4-self-reference-in-annotation-is-out-of-scope

- spec: S2; `39 §5.3`; LET-4 AC2
- given: `const self_type_bad : Nat = let self_type_probe : self_type_probe =
  Zero; ok = Zero in ok`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface) — rejected** with
  `UnresolvedCon { name = "self_type_probe" }` at the annotation occurrence.
  The harness must prove resolution stopped there; a later type error is not
  the required result.
- why: S2 applies the nonrecursive boundary independently to annotations and
  right-hand sides. The preceding case alone would leave the annotation path
  free to push the binder early.

### surface/elaboration/let4-later-reference-is-out-of-scope

- spec: S2; `39 §5.3`; LET-4 AC2
- given: `const later_bad : Nat = let first : Nat = later_group_probe;
  later_group_probe = Zero in first`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface) — rejected** with
  `UnresolvedCon { name = "later_group_probe" }` at the first RHS occurrence.
- why: the same source accepts after only the binding order is reversed. This
  distinguishes sequential scope from simultaneous scope while holding names,
  types, and body fixed.

### surface/elaboration/let4-later-type-is-out-of-scope

- spec: S2; `39 §5.3`; LET-4 AC2
- given: `const later_type_bad : Nat = let first : later_type_probe = Zero;
  later_type_probe : Type = Nat in first`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface) — rejected** with
  `UnresolvedCon { name = "later_type_probe" }` at the first annotation.
  Reversing only the binding order accepts.
- why: this is the annotation counterpart to the later-RHS case. A parser or
  resolver that predeclares all group names would accept both and fail this
  verdict flip.

### surface/elaboration/let4-duplicate-name-is-focused-reject

- spec: S5; LET-4 AC2
- given: `const duplicate : Nat = let stage = Zero; stage = Suc stage in stage`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface) — rejected** by the specific
  duplicate-let-binding diagnostic carrying `name = "stage"` and pointing at
  the second binding name. The spec does not yet lock a Rust enum spelling, so
  this case pins the diagnostic category, payload, and span rather than
  inventing one.
- why: under ordinary nested-let shadowing the source has a meaning; the focused
  group diagnostic is therefore the only observable that distinguishes S5 from
  silently lowering first and applying the nested rule.

### surface/elaboration/let4-nested-body-shadowing-remains-valid

- spec: S5; ordinary lexical shadowing in `39 §5.3`; LET-4 AC2
- given: `const shadow : Nat = let stage = Zero; next = Suc stage in let stage =
  Suc next in stage`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface) — accepted**. The inner single-binding let
  is outside the sibling group and may shadow the group binder.
- why: positive de-selection prevents S5 from becoming a blanket ban on lexical
  shadowing.

---

## C. Lowering, evaluation, and effects

### surface/elaboration/let4-grouped-and-nested-core-are-identical

- spec: S3; `39` local-let lowering; LET-4 AC3
- given: the pair
  `let first = Zero; second = Suc first in Suc second` and
  `let first = Zero in let second = Suc first in Suc second`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface)** — after erasing source spans, both
  resolved trees and stable core serializations are byte-identical. Each is the
  same ordered two-node `Term::Let` nest: the outer value is `Zero`; the inner
  value refers to the outer binder; the final body refers to the inner binder.
  The `trusted_base()` sets are equal.
- why: two successful elaborations are green-vs-green under a grouped AST that
  never lowers correctly. Ordered structural identity makes a swapped or
  simultaneous lowering observable.

### surface/elaboration/let4-strict-pure-evaluation-matches-nested

- spec: S4; `42 §3.2`; LET-4 AC4
- given: the grouped and nested pair from the preceding case
- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface)** — each evaluates to `Suc (Suc Zero)`;
  each RHS is evaluated once before the next stage.
- why: the concrete value verifies feed-forward evaluation. Core identity is
  still the stronger order/sharing oracle; this value case does not substitute
  for it.

### surface/elaboration/let4-sugar-adds-no-trust-or-core-form

- spec: S3; `39 §1`; LET-4 AC3
- given: elaborate the grouped source from
  `let4-grouped-and-nested-core-are-identical` in a fresh environment, while
  recording the core constructors and `trusted_base()` before and after
- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface)** — the output uses only the existing
  `Term::Let` constructor, adds no opaque declaration or trusted-base entry,
  and requires no kernel/runtime-IR/prelude/Cargo change.
- why: the grouped surface is sugar. Core equality with the nested control plus
  exact trusted-base set equality catches both an accidental new core form and
  a hidden postulate used to justify the lowering.

### surface/elaboration/let4-effect-tree-is-source-ordered

- spec: S4; `36 §2.2`/`§2.4`; LET-4 AC4; existing interaction-tree order home
  `../effects/seed-effects.md` EFF2
- given: grouped and explicitly nested forms of
  `let first = perform Console (Write "1"); second = perform Clock now in second`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface)** — both lower to the same ordered tree
  `Vis (Write "1") (λ _. Vis now (λ second. Ret second))`; the observable mock
  trace is `[Console.Write "1", Clock.now]`.
- why: two distinguishable effects make source order observable. Reversing or
  hoisting a binding changes the `Vis` spine and trace; merely comparing final
  values would be vacuous.

---

## D. Exact canonical layout — both orientations

For every D case the harness performs both assertions:

1. the stated noncanonical/alias input formats to the exact canonical bytes;
2. those canonical bytes format to themselves.

It also compares lowered AST/core identity before and after formatting. Raw
surface-token equality is not required when S6 coalesces repeated `let`/`in`
tokens into the grouped spelling.

### surface/formatting/let4-short-one-binding-stays-horizontal

- spec: S6; `31 §1d`; LET-4 AC5.1
- given: `const tiny : Nat = let x : Nat = Zero in x`
- expect: **LIVE canonical bytes**:

  ```ken ignore
  const tiny : Nat = let x : Nat = Zero in x
  ```

- why: the grouped canonicalization rule does not pessimize a fitting
  cardinality-one let.

### surface/formatting/let4-short-group-is-horizontal

- spec: S6; `31 §1d`; LET-4 AC5.2
- given: `const tiny : Nat = let x=Zero ; y = Suc x in y`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface + formatter)** — canonical bytes:

  ```ken ignore
  const tiny : Nat = let x = Zero; y = Suc x in y
  ```

- why: the complete expression fits within 96 display columns, so S6 selects
  the unique horizontal production; spacing follows `31 §1d`.

### surface/formatting/let4-long-group-uses-one-flat-level

- spec: S6; `31 §1d`; LET-4 AC5.3/AC5.4
- given:

  ```ken ignore
  fn chars (left : String) (right : String) : List Char = let left_chars:List Char=string_to_list_char left ; right_chars : List Char = string_to_list_char right; joined_chars: List Char=append Char left_chars right_chars ; final_chars : List Char = joined_chars in final_chars
  ```

- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface + formatter)** — canonical bytes:

  ```ken ignore
  fn chars (left : String) (right : String) : List Char =
    let
      left_chars : List Char = string_to_list_char left;
      right_chars : List Char = string_to_list_char right;
      joined_chars : List Char = append Char left_chars right_chars;
      final_chars : List Char = joined_chars
    in
      final_chars
  ```

- why: the whole expression does not fit, so S6 selects the block production.
  All four bindings and the final body have the same indentation; `List Char`
  stays an atomic fitting subgroup, and there is no trailing `;`.

### surface/formatting/let4-compound-match-rhs-nests-under-binding

- spec: S6; `31 §1d` match production; LET-4 AC5.5
- given: the guide declaration with its group written horizontally and an ASCII
  match arrow:

  ```ken ignore
  fn let_staged_color (c : Color) : Bool = let selected_red=is_red c; confirmed_red = match selected_red { True |-> True ; False |-> False } in confirmed_red
  ```

- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface + formatter)** — canonical bytes:

  ```ken ignore
  fn let_staged_color (c : Color) : Bool =
    let
      selected_red = is_red c;
      confirmed_red =
        match selected_red {
          True ↦ True;
          False ↦ False
        }
    in
      confirmed_red
  ```

- why: the first fitting RHS remains beside its binding; the compound match
  nests one level under the second binding. The group body returns to the
  bindings' indentation rather than continuing a nested-let staircase.

### surface/formatting/let4-group-in-match-arm-has-disjoint-semicolons

- spec: S1/S6; `31 §1d` match production; LET-4 AC5.6
- given:

  ```ken ignore
  fn branch_value (flag : Bool) : Nat = match flag { True |-> let first=Zero ; second=Suc first in second ; False |-> Zero }
  ```

- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface + formatter)** — canonical bytes:

  ```ken ignore
  fn branch_value (flag : Bool) : Nat =
    match flag {
      True ↦
        let
          first = Zero;
          second = Suc first
        in
          second;
      False ↦ Zero
    }
  ```

- why: the binding `;` follows `first`; the arm `;` follows the complete body
  `second` after `in`. The final body aligns with both binding rows, relative to
  the arm, and the let is not hoisted.

### surface/formatting/let4-comments-retain-binding-attachment

- spec: S6; `31 §1d` comments; LET-4 AC5.7
- given:

  ```ken ignore
  const commented : Nat = let -- establish the seed
  first=Zero ; -- consume the prior stage
  second = Suc first; result=Suc second -- final stage
  in result
  ```

- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface + formatter)** — canonical bytes:

  ```ken ignore
  const commented : Nat =
    let
      -- establish the seed
      first = Zero;
      -- consume the prior stage
      second = Suc first;
      result = Suc second  -- final stage
    in
      result
  ```

- why: exact text alone would be green under comment relocation. The harness
  additionally asserts each comment's attached binding identity and token
  interval; none crosses a binding separator or `in`.

### surface/formatting/let4-nested-chain-coalesces-to-group

- spec: S3/S6; `31 §1d`; LET-4 AC5.8
- given:
  `const tiny : Nat = let x = Zero in let y = Suc x in y`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface + formatter)** — the exact horizontal
  bytes from `let4-short-group-is-horizontal`:

  ```ken ignore
  const tiny : Nat = let x = Zero; y = Suc x in y
  ```

- why: this is S6's explicit canonicalization direction. The reverse input is
  already the fixed point, and both lower to the same ordered core nest.

### surface/formatting/let4-shadow-starts-new-coalescing-segment

- spec: S5/S6; `31 §1d`; LET-4 AC5
- given:
  `const shadow : Nat = let stage = Zero in let next = Suc stage in let stage =
  Suc next in stage`
- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface + formatter)** — canonical bytes:

  ```ken ignore
  const shadow : Nat =
    let
      stage = Zero;
      next = Suc stage
    in
      let stage = Suc next in stage
  ```

  The noncanonical input formats to these exact bytes, these bytes format to
  themselves, and both forms have identical lowered AST/core terms modulo
  spans.
- why: `stage; next` is the longest outer pairwise-distinct segment. The second
  `stage` begins a new one-binding nested segment, so formatting preserves
  legal lexical shadowing rather than emitting one rejected duplicate-name
  group. The outer group is block-form because its body is compound; the
  simple fitting inner let remains horizontal.

### surface/formatting/let4-comments-preserve-nested-chain-maximality

- spec: S6; `31 §1d` comments; LET-4 AC5/AC6
- given:

  ```ken ignore
  const commented_nested : Nat =
    let first = Zero in
      -- keep the second stage
      let second = Suc first in second
  ```

- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface + formatter)** — canonical bytes:

  ```ken ignore
  const commented_nested : Nat =
    let
      first = Zero;
      -- keep the second stage
      second = Suc first
    in
      second
  ```

  The noncanonical input formats to these exact bytes, these bytes format to
  themselves, and both forms have identical lowered AST/core terms modulo
  spans. The harness additionally asserts that the comment remains owned by
  the `second` binding with the same token interval.
- why: the comment forces block form but does not break the directly nested
  chain's maximality. The pair still coalesces, while the comment crosses
  neither the binding boundary nor the final `in` boundary.

### surface/formatting/let4-literate-fence-changes-only-group-body

- spec: S6; `31 §1d` literate source; LET-4 AC6
- given: this document, with irregular grouped spacing:

  ````markdown
  Narrative → stays byte-identical.

  ```ken example
  const tiny : Nat = let x=Zero ; y=Suc x in y
  ```

  ```text
  let x = not Ken
  ```
  ````

- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface + formatter)** — exact bytes:

  ````markdown
  Narrative → stays byte-identical.

  ```ken example
  const tiny : Nat = let x = Zero; y = Suc x in y
  ```

  ```text
  let x = not Ken
  ```
  ````

- why: the recognized Ken body takes the same D2 canonical form. Markdown,
  fence markers, and the unrecognized `text` body are byte-identical, so a raw
  document-wide rewrite cannot pass.

### surface/formatting/let4-cli-covers-plain-and-literate-groups

- spec: S6; `31 §1d` physical and literate source; LET-4 AC6
- given: temporary `.ken` and `.ken.md` files containing the D2 and D10 inputs,
  respectively
- expect: **RED-UNTIL (LET-4 surface + formatter)** — `ken fmt` produces the
  exact D2 and D10 canonical bytes; `ken fmt --check` then succeeds without a
  byte change; and `ken check` accepts each formatted file through its real
  plain-source or literate pipeline.
- why: direct library formatting can be green while CLI routing omits a file
  kind or checks the pre-format bytes. Reusing the exact goldens makes this an
  integration gate, not a second layout oracle.

---

## E. AC-READER — human judgment, not a test result

The handoff must paste, verbatim, the canonical outputs from:

1. `let4-long-group-uses-one-flat-level`;
2. `let4-group-in-match-arm-has-disjoint-semicolons`; and
3. `let4-compound-match-rhs-nests-under-binding` (`let_staged_color`).

A human-equivalent reader must state that in each output every sibling binding
and the final body sit at the same indentation relative to their `let`/`in`, and
that the body is not indented deeper than the first binding. Passing the byte
goldens, fixed-point check, 96-column bound, AST/core comparison, or trust check
does **not** discharge this section.
