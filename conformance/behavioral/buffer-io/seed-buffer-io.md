# Buffer I/O and multi-resource conformance — seed cases (PX8-T)

Format: `../../README.md`. These cases pin the PX8 contracts consumed by the
runtime and Foundation lanes: role-labelled multi-resource observations, the
direct lifetime body for external Ward, positioned positive progress,
`writeAll`, resource-kind mismatch, deterministic buffer admission limits, and
PX8-SPAN-PROV's exact-acquisition binding for `BufferSpan`.

The cases are contract roots, not claims that PX8 is already built. Every case
names the producer whose arrival makes it reachable. A schema-unit value or a
hand-fed successful result cannot satisfy a case that requires the real host,
export, derived-Ken, or external-Ward route.

## Producer grounding and locked vocabulary

The PX8-X train supplies the sole observation and export route:

- `HostOpV1::{FsOpen, FsHandleMetadata, FsReadAt, FsWriteAt,
  ResourceRelease, BufferAllocate, BufferFreeze}` and
  `ResourceKindV1::{FsHandle, Buffer}` are real in
  `crates/ken-host/src/effect_v1.rs`;
- the sole `EffectEvent.resource_bindings` carries ordered
  `(ResourceBindingRole, ResourceTraceIdentityV1)` pairs;
- the direct `ResourceLifetimeObligation` and its canonical `T`-hash route are
  real in `crates/ken-elaborator/src/export.rs`;
- the checked file-only `px7f_export_resource` fixture has the
  denotation-derived alphabet `{FsOpen, FsHandleMetadata, ResourceRelease}`
  (and not `FS`) plus the coherent direct body required by I3; and
- the checked buffer-only producer in
  `crates/ken-elaborator/tests/px8x_static_export_projection.rs` has the
  direct Buffer plan and export hash
  `ken-export-v0:47f2f35b7a825ca3`; and
- the exact checked no-acquire regression producer has export hash
  `ken-export-v0:6360c2cb74f78f7e`.

The train does not make the remaining PX8 contracts current by itself. The
surface progress sums, `writeAll`, bounded native lowering, deterministic
`BufferLimitsV1` admission, and external Ward monitor execution remain behind
the named PX8-R, PX8-F, and external-Ward reachability gates below. These cases
do not
hand-feed those missing routes.

The fixed PX8 vocabulary is:

```text
ResourceBindingRole = File | Buffer | Target

resource_bindings:
  [(ResourceBindingRole, ResourceTraceIdentityV1)]

ReadProgress =
  ReadSome BufferSpan TransferCount
  | ReadEof

WriteProgress =
  Wrote TransferCount

ResourceKindMismatch {
  expected: ResourceKindV1,
  actual: ResourceKindV1,
}

BufferLimitsV1 {
  per_buffer_max_capacity: Int,
  invocation_max_live_capacity: Int,
}
```

`resource_bindings` is a runtime observation field. Its identities are minted
at acquisition and are not serialized in the target-level `T` entry. The
static lifetime body serializes the role-specific bind/match policy and the
per-kind acquire/use/settle plans that govern those runtime bindings. The whole
static body is canonicalized with `T`; runtime identities are not export or
hash inputs.

Each operation's ordered binding sequence is exact:

```text
successful FsOpen          -> [(Target, file_r)]
successful BufferAllocate  -> [(Target, buffer_r)]
FsHandleMetadata           -> [(Target, file_r)]
FsReadAt                   -> [(File, file_r), (Buffer, buffer_r)]
FsWriteAt                  -> [(File, file_r), (Buffer, buffer_r)]
BufferFreeze               -> [(Target, buffer_r)]
ResourceRelease            -> [(Target, released_r)]
```

For a target whose reachable alphabet contains the complete file-and-buffer
inventory, the direct static body has this field set, nesting, and order:

```text
ResourceLifetimeObligation {
  body_kind: ResourceLifetimeObligation,
  obligation_id: String,
  status: delegated,
  correlation: ResourceLifetimeCorrelation {
    identity_type: ResourceTraceIdentityV1,
    event_field: EffectEvent.resource_bindings,
    role_type: ResourceBindingRole,
    canonical_order: OperationDefined,
  },
  plans: [
    ResourceLifetimePlan {
      resource_kind: FsHandle,
      bind_at: Successful(FsOpen, Target),
      require_same_at: [
        (FsHandleMetadata, Target),
        (FsReadAt, File),
        (FsWriteAt, File),
        (ResourceRelease, Target),
      ],
    },
    ResourceLifetimePlan {
      resource_kind: Buffer,
      bind_at: Successful(BufferAllocate, Target),
      require_same_at: [
        (FsReadAt, Buffer),
        (FsWriteAt, Buffer),
        (BufferFreeze, Target),
        (ResourceRelease, Target),
      ],
    },
  ],
  monitor_template: WardResourceLifetimeMonitor {
    correlate_every_role_binding: true,
    successful_acquire_settles_exactly_once: true,
    forbid_successful_use_after_settlement: true,
    require_no_live_bracket_owned_identity_on:
      [NormalReturn, ReturnedError, ControlledTrap],
    retain_settlement_outcome: true,
  },
}
```

The `FsHandle` plan precedes the `Buffer` plan, and each operation list keeps
the order above. A target emits only a plan whose acquisition is in its exact
reachable alphabet `Σ`. Each emitted `require_same_at` is the canonical ordered
subsequence of that kind's inventory whose operations are also in `Σ`; it
neither invents an unreachable operation nor omits a reachable one. For every
identity selected by an emitted plan, the external Ward monitor
requires exactly one settlement, forbids successful use after settlement,
retains the settlement outcome, and requires no live bracket-owned identity at
`NormalReturn`, `ReturnedError`, or `ControlledTrap`. The entire static entry,
including its `delegated` status, correlation descriptor, ordered plans, and
monitor template, is canonicalized in `T` and contributes to the export hash.
Runtime identities such as `file_r` and `buffer_r` do not.

## RB-A. Canonical two-resource observation validates

### buffer-io/file-buffer-bindings-validate

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R producer + PX8-V export route + PX8-F surface +
  external Ward consumer; Ward-delegated / out-of-Ken**
- spec: `71 §2.3/§3.1/§3.3`; PX8-T D1/AC1; Architect PX8 ruling,
  “Buffer ownership and lifetime”; ADR 0021, “Expressibility prerequisite”
- given: a checked full-inventory two-resource target whose exact reachable
  `Σ` contains both acquisitions and every operation in the two global
  inventories; its real runtime observation includes
  `FsReadAt -> [(File, file_r), (Buffer, buffer_r)]`, and the Spec-owned direct
  lifetime body is emitted through the real export route
- expect: schema validation accepts the exact ordered binding; the `T` body
  contains both per-kind plans and the Ward monitor policy; its status is
  `delegated`; the static body, not `file_r` or `buffer_r`, contributes to the
  export hash
- expect: external Ward binds `file_r` at `Successful(FsOpen, Target)` and
  `buffer_r`
  at `Successful(BufferAllocate, Target)`, requires those same identities in
  the `File` and `Buffer` roles of `FsReadAt`, and matches each later
  `ResourceRelease(Target, r)` to the appropriate plan
- why: one elected identity, a request-byte token, or two unlabelled identities
  cannot satisfy this exact ordered pair and policy.

## RB-B. Malformed binding is rejected

### buffer-io/missing-buffer-role-rejected

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R producer + PX8-V export route + PX8-F surface +
  external Ward consumer; Ward-delegated / out-of-Ken**
- spec: `71 §2.3`; PX8-T D1/AC6
- given: the RB-A observation and lifetime body, changing only the `FsReadAt`
  binding to `[(File, file_r)]`
- expect: static export produces the same canonical `T` bytes and hash as RB-A;
  observation validation rejects the malformed runtime event, and external Ward does
  not accept it as discharging either emitted plan
- why: an operation-name-only or one-resource validator accepts both RB-A and
  RB-B. The correct route accepts RB-A and rejects RB-B on the missing role
  alone.

## RB-C. Swapped role labels are rejected

### buffer-io/swapped-role-labels-rejected

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R producer + PX8-V export route + PX8-F surface +
  external Ward consumer; Ward-delegated / out-of-Ken**
- spec: `71 §2.3`; PX8-T D1/AC6
- given: the RB-A observation and lifetime body, changing only the two role
  labels to `[(Buffer, file_r), (File, buffer_r)]`
- expect: static export produces the same canonical `T` bytes and hash as RB-A;
  observation validation rejects the wrongly labelled runtime event, and
  external Ward does not accept it as discharging either emitted plan
- why: an order-only validator sees two identities in the expected positions
  and accepts both RB-A and RB-C. The exact role labels alone must flip the
  verdict.

## RB-D. An out-of-order pair is rejected

### buffer-io/out-of-order-pair-rejected

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R producer + PX8-V export route + PX8-F surface +
  external Ward consumer; Ward-delegated / out-of-Ken**
- spec: `71 §2.3`; PX8-T D1/AC6
- given: the RB-A observation and lifetime body, preserving both labelled
  tuples but reversing their sequence to
  `[(Buffer, buffer_r), (File, file_r)]`
- expect: static export produces the same canonical `T` bytes and hash as RB-A;
  observation validation rejects the misordered runtime event, and external Ward does
  not reorder it into a discharge
- why: a map-shaped or sorting validator accepts RB-A and RB-D. Canonical
  operation-defined order is the only varied property.

## RB-E. Two single-resource atoms cannot replace one correlated event

### buffer-io/independent-single-resource-atoms-rejected

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R producer + PX8-V export route + PX8-F surface +
  external Ward consumer; Ward-delegated / out-of-Ken**
- spec: `71 §2.3`; PX8-T D1/AC6
- given: the RB-A target and identities, replacing its one
  `FsReadAt -> [(File, file_r), (Buffer, buffer_r)]` observation with two
  independent `FsReadAt` atoms, one carrying only `[(File, file_r)]` and one
  carrying only `[(Buffer, buffer_r)]`
- expect: static export produces the same canonical `T` bytes and hash as RB-A;
  observation validation rejects both malformed runtime events, and external
  Ward does not merge independent atoms into a synthetic pair
- why: unioning bindings across events accepts the same identities while
  losing the single-operation correlation that the direct schema expresses.

## RB-F. Uncorrelated lookalike is rejected

### buffer-io/buffer-identity-must-correlate

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R producer + PX8-V export route + PX8-F surface +
  external Ward consumer; Ward-delegated / out-of-Ken**
- spec: `71 §2.3`; PX8-T D1/AC6
- given: hold operation, role order, file identity, plans, and monitor policy
  fixed; compare:
  - positive: `BufferAllocate(buffer_r1); FsReadAt(File=file_r,
    Buffer=buffer_r1); ResourceRelease(Target=buffer_r1)`;
  - negative: `BufferAllocate(buffer_r1); FsReadAt(File=file_r,
    Buffer=buffer_r2); ResourceRelease(Target=buffer_r1)`, where
    `buffer_r1 != buffer_r2`
- expect: both traces use the same already-emitted canonical `T` bytes and
  export hash; runtime identities never become static hash inputs
- expect: the positive trace satisfies the Buffer plan; the negative trace
  fails the external-Ward obligation because `buffer_r1` remains unmatched at the use
  site and `buffer_r2` has no corresponding acquisition
- why: role labels without same-identity matching accept both. Identity is the
  only varied field, so the verdict flip is not confounded.

## RB-G. Resource exports rebaseline once; no-acquire bytes stay fixed

### buffer-io/direct-file-only-rebaseline-and-no-acquire-control

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-V export route; Ward-delegated / out-of-Ken**
- spec: `71 §2.3/§3.3`; PX8-T D1/AC2
- given: run the landed checked `RESOURCE_PRODUCER`, target
  `px7f_export_resource`, from
  `crates/ken-elaborator/tests/px7f_resource_lifetime_export.rs` on the sole
  schema route; its reachable alphabet contains `FsOpen` but no buffer
  acquisition
- expect: the run derives exactly the alphabet
  `{FsOpen, FsHandleMetadata, ResourceRelease}`, exclude `FS`, and emit the same
  direct `ResourceLifetimeObligation` file-only plan required by I3; its one
  intentional schema-collapse rebaseline is
  `ken-export-v0:1bf3cb3f5b648ea7`
- given: also run the existing checked no-acquire producer from that test
- expect: it emits no `ResourceLifetimeObligation`; its frozen hash remains
  `ken-export-v0:6360c2cb74f78f7e`
- why: the file-only hash proves the resource-producing route moved to the sole
  direct body. The no-acquire fixture independently proves that an export with
  no resource-lifetime body was not perturbed and is a negative control, not a
  compatibility promise.

## RB-H. A versioned wrapper rejects before export

### buffer-io/versioned-wrapper-rejected-pre-export

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R + PX8-V export route; Ward-delegated /
  out-of-Ken**
- spec: `71 §2.3/§3.1/§3.3`; PX8-T D1/AC6
- given: the exact direct RB-A static target and body, changing only the body
  shape by adding `schema_version: 2`
- expect: schema validation rejects before canonical `T` bytes or an export
  hash are emitted
- why: the sole schema has no version selector or compatibility wrapper.
  Runtime or external-Ward rejection is too late for a malformed static
  descriptor.

## RB-I. Wrong direct descriptor rejects before export

### buffer-io/wrong-correlation-descriptor-rejected-pre-export

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R + PX8-V export route; Ward-delegated /
  out-of-Ken**
- spec: `71 §2.3/§3.1/§3.3`; PX8-T D1/AC6
- given: the exact RB-A static target and body, changing only
  `event_field: EffectEvent.resource_bindings` to
  `event_field: EffectEvent.capability`
- expect: schema validation rejects before canonical `T` bytes or an export
  hash are emitted
- why: the capability field cannot carry ordered role-labelled resource
  identities; a field-name-only serializer would otherwise hash an
  unmonitorable policy.

## RB-J. Missing reachable plan rejects before export

### buffer-io/missing-reachable-buffer-plan-rejected-pre-export

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R + PX8-V export route; Ward-delegated /
  out-of-Ken**
- spec: `71 §2.3/§3.1/§3.3`; PX8-T D1/AC6; `71 §3.1` I3
- given: the exact RB-A target and body, whose `Σ` contains both acquisitions,
  changing only `plans` by removing the Buffer plan
- expect: static-policy validation rejects before canonical `T` bytes or an
  export hash are emitted
- why: a merely optional plan list would leave a reachable buffer identity
  outside the monitor policy while still claiming the same target alphabet.

## RB-K. Noncanonical plan order rejects before export

### buffer-io/plan-order-rejected-pre-export

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R + PX8-V export route; Ward-delegated /
  out-of-Ken**
- spec: `71 §2.3/§3.1/§3.3`; PX8-T D1/AC6
- given: the exact RB-A target and body, preserving both complete plans but
  reversing them to Buffer then FsHandle
- expect: static-policy validation rejects before canonical `T` bytes or an
  export hash are emitted
- why: treating plans as a map admits two serializations and therefore two
  hashes for the same checked target.

## RB-L. Buffer-only targets emit only their reachable plan

### buffer-io/buffer-only-plan-is-sigma-specialized

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R + PX8-V export route; Ward-delegated /
  out-of-Ken**
- spec: `71 §2.3/§3.1/§3.3`; PX8-T D1/AC1; `71 §3.1` I3
- given: the checked buffer-only producer grounded above, whose exact reachable
  alphabet `Σ` is `{BufferAllocate, BufferFreeze, ResourceRelease}`
- expect: the direct entry contains exactly one Buffer plan, with
  `bind_at: Successful(BufferAllocate, Target)` and
  `require_same_at: [(BufferFreeze, Target), (ResourceRelease, Target)]`;
  it contains no FsHandle plan, `FsReadAt`, or `FsWriteAt`
- expect: the entry validates I3, is canonicalized in `T`, and is covered by
  exact export hash `ken-export-v0:47f2f35b7a825ca3`
- why: the target is non-degenerate because it acquires, uses, and settles a
  buffer, while any fixed two-plan emitter hashes operations absent from `Σ`.

## RB-M. Read-only positioned targets omit unreachable writes

### buffer-io/read-only-positioned-plan-is-sigma-specialized

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R + PX8-V export route; Ward-delegated /
  out-of-Ken**
- spec: `71 §2.3/§3.1/§3.3`; PX8-T D1/AC1; `71 §3.1` I3
- given: a checked positioned-read target whose exact reachable alphabet `Σ`
  is `{FsOpen, BufferAllocate, FsReadAt, ResourceRelease}`
- expect: the direct entry contains the FsHandle plan
  `[(FsReadAt, File), (ResourceRelease, Target)]` followed by the Buffer plan
  `[(FsReadAt, Buffer), (ResourceRelease, Target)]`
- expect: neither plan names `FsHandleMetadata`, `FsWriteAt`, or
  `BufferFreeze`; the entry validates I3, is canonicalized in `T`, and is
  covered by the export hash
- why: preserving canonical global order while filtering by exact `Σ`
  distinguishes specialization from a fixed full inventory or ad hoc sorting.

## RB-N. An extra unreachable operation violates I3

### buffer-io/extra-unreachable-operation-rejected-pre-export

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R + PX8-V export route; Ward-delegated /
  out-of-Ken**
- spec: `71 §2.3/§3.1/§3.3`; PX8-T D1/AC6; `71 §3.1` I3
- given: the RB-L buffer-only target and specialized body, changing only the
  Buffer `require_same_at` by inserting `(FsWriteAt, Buffer)`, which is absent
  from that target's exact `Σ`
- expect: static-policy/I3 validation rejects before canonical `T` bytes or an
  export hash are emitted
- why: a kind-wide inventory emitter accepts the extra operation; exact
  alphabet closure rejects policy that the target cannot execute.

## RB-O. A duplicated runtime role binding is rejected

### buffer-io/duplicated-runtime-role-binding-rejected

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R producer + PX8-V export route + PX8-F surface +
  external Ward consumer; Ward-delegated / out-of-Ken**
- spec: `71 §2.3`; PX8-T D1/AC6
- given: the RB-A observation and lifetime body, changing only the `FsReadAt`
  binding sequence to
  `[(File, file_r), (Buffer, buffer_r), (Buffer, buffer_r)]`
- expect: static export produces the same canonical `T` bytes and hash as RB-A;
  observation validation rejects the duplicated runtime role, and external Ward does
  not discard or coalesce it into a discharge
- why: a set-shaped or first-binding-wins validator accepts both RB-A and RB-O.
  Exact operation-defined sequence cardinality is the only varied property.

## PR-A. Exact read/write progress partition

### buffer-io/positive-short-is-success-zero-write-is-error

- status: **GREEN — PX8-R producer + PX8-F checked surface/Verify companion**
- spec: `38 §1.7.2`; PX8-T D2/D3/AC3
- evidence: `effect_v1::tests::bounded_positioned_io_reaches_progress_mismatch_and_ordered_bindings`
  plus `px8f_write_partition::checked_write_all_reaches_full_short_zero_progress_flip_and_error_prefixes`
- given: positive effective requests of length `8`
- expect:
  - read `0` -> `ReadEof`;
  - read `3` -> `ReadSome span n`, with `n = 3` and `span.length = 3`;
  - write `3` -> `Wrote n`, with `n = 3`; and
  - write syscall `0` -> `Err NoProgress`, never `Wrote 0`
- expect: neither closed sum contains `Complete`, `Partial`, or `WouldBlock`;
  `TransferCount` cannot be constructed with zero and projects a strictly
  positive `Int`
- why: the four outcomes distinguish EOF, positive short success, and the
  load-bearing zero-write failure. A generic status/count record can represent
  forbidden combinations and fails this shape.

### buffer-io/short-read-preserves-request-budget

- status: **GREEN — RT-PARITY interpreter repair; native was canonical**
- spec: `38 §1.7.2`; RT-PARITY AC2
- evidence:
  `eval::px5b_effect_observation_tests::`
  `rt_parity_short_read_reifies_remaining_and_request_budget`
- given: a real file containing one byte, a capacity-`8` live buffer, and an
  `FsReadAt` request of length `4`
- expect: `ReadSome` carries transferred `1`, remaining `3`, and total request
  budget `1 + 3 = 4`; its returned `BufferSpan` has length `1`
- pre-fix failure: interpreter reification hardcoded remaining to `0`, so it
  produced budget `1` while native produced the required budget `4`
- why: the existing PR-A full-read arm has remaining `0` legitimately and is
  green before and after the repair. This positive short read is the
  discriminator that makes a constant-zero remaining field fail.

## PR-PARITY. Host-width narrowing precedes resource dispatch

### buffer-io/interpreter-native-host-width-error-parity

- status: **GREEN — RT-PARITY interpreter repair; native was canonical**
- spec: `38 §1.7.1/§1.7.2`; PX8-I; RT-PARITY AC3–AC5
- evidence, at two levels — the dispatch boundary and the executable
  cross-executor differential. Each case is its own test, so each reaches
  independently. **Reaching independently is not the same as flipping**, and
  they are not co-extensive here: the per-case flip table below is
  authoritative about which cases actually discriminate the defect, and three
  dispatch-boundary single-fault pins plus the one non-narrowing differential
  case deliberately do not flip:
  - dispatch boundary (interpreter, exact variant per consumer):
    `eval::px5b_effect_observation_tests::rt_parity_*` —
    `buffer_allocate_rejects_malformed_capacity_exactly`,
    `fs_read_at_rejects_malformed_offset_exactly`,
    `fs_write_at_rejects_malformed_offset_exactly`,
    `buffer_freeze_rejects_malformed_bounds_exactly`,
    `malformed_read_offset_precedes_closed_resource`,
    `malformed_write_offset_precedes_missing_right`,
    `malformed_freeze_bounds_precede_closed_resource`
  - executable differential (`ken-cli`, linked native artifact against the
    reference interpreter on the same root):
    `rt_parity_native.rs`
- given and expect, at the dispatch boundary:

  | Consumer | Single out-of-range input | Overlapping resource fault | Exact result |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `BufferAllocate` | capacity `-1` | unreachable: the operation consumes no resource | `InvalidBounds` |
  | `FsReadAt` | file offset `-1` with live resources | the same offset with a closed file | `InvalidOffset` |
  | `FsWriteAt` | file offset `-1` with a writable file | the same offset with a read-only file | `InvalidOffset` |
  | `BufferFreeze` | start `-1` with a live buffer | the same start with a closed buffer | `InvalidBounds` |

- given and expect, in the executable differential: the linked native artifact
  and the reference interpreter must observe the *same exact* variant. Each
  fixture matches the one expected `ResourceError` constructor and exits `0`,
  taking a distinct non-zero exit on any other constructor, so the assertion is
  on exact public identity rather than on failure. A second, independent axis
  asserts that neither executor records a canonical effect event for the
  narrowed operation: after the repair the interpreter no longer enters shared
  dispatch, matching native, whereas before it recorded an event native never
  had.

  | Consumer | Single out-of-range input | Overlapping resource fault | Exact result |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `BufferAllocate` | capacity `-1` | unreachable: the operation consumes no resource | `InvalidBounds` |
  | `FsReadAt` | file offset `-1` with the read right held | the same offset without the read right | `InvalidOffset` |
  | `FsReadAt` | window start `-1` with live resources | — (covered by the offset pair) | `InvalidBounds` |
  | `FsWriteAt` | file offset `-1` with the write right held | the same offset without the write right | `InvalidOffset` |
  | `BufferFreeze` | not constructible at the landed surface — see below | not constructible at the landed surface | — |

- pre-fix failure, measured per case against `origin/main` production with
  these tests retained. **Which cases discriminate is not uniform, and the
  difference is intrinsic.** A malformed argument became `u64::MAX` for every
  consumer except allocation, and shared dispatch rejects `u64::MAX` with the
  *same* `InvalidOffset`/`InvalidBounds` the repair produces — so at the
  dispatch boundary no single-fault input can separate the implementations for
  those consumers:
  - flips at the dispatch boundary: the short-read budget case; the
    `BufferAllocate` single fault (its sentinel `0` is a *lawful* capacity, so
    it surfaced `BufferLimit`); and all three overlapping-fault cases, where
    `Closed`/`RightNotHeld` won the race into dispatch.
  - does **not** flip there: the `FsReadAt`, `FsWriteAt` and `BufferFreeze`
    single-fault cases. They are exact-variant regression pins, not
    discriminating nets, and are never cited as flip evidence; the
    overlapping-fault cases carry the proof for those consumers.
  - in the differential, all six **narrowing** cases flip, because the
    dispatch-skip axis separates the implementations even where the variant
    axis cannot: pre-fix the interpreter still entered dispatch and recorded a
    canonical event native never had. The allocation and both
    overlapping-fault cases flip on the variant axis; the three single-fault
    cases flip on the dispatch-skip axis. The one **non-narrowing** case
    deliberately does not flip and is never cited as flip evidence: the
    producer-closure case is a source-scope pin that runs no fixture.
- `BufferAllocate` verdict: **defect, fails closed, same early-narrow remedy.**
  Its substituted `0` does not silently succeed because `ResourceTableV1`
  rejects zero capacity as `BufferLimit`. It still exposes the wrong public
  variant versus native. An overlapping resource discriminator is
  structurally impossible because allocation has no resource input.
- `BufferFreeze` reachability: the differential has **no narrowing case** for
  this consumer, because no malformed span is constructible from checked source
  **at the landed surface**. That is an **empirical finding about the code as it
  stands**, not a derived closure result. The distinction is load-bearing, and
  it is spelled out because two earlier revisions of this entry claimed more
  than the evidence supports — the first inferred it from constructor-name
  privacy, the second from an empty oracle result. Both were blocked.

  **What is established.** Source-level span forgery is rejected today:
  `PrivateBufferSpan` and the now-sealed `write_all_advance_span` are both
  unnameable from checked source. An independent adversary sweep (SPAN-SEAL)
  separately found the seal holds, including a wrapped-inclusive search and
  direct forgery attempts.

  **What the landed oracle does and does not give.** `px8f_buffer_io_surface`
  asserts that the set of public globals whose result type is `BufferSpan` is
  empty, along three axes: modulo definitional equality
  (`buffer_span_producer_closure_reduces_transparent_type_aliases`); over
  declarations **and** constructors
  (`buffer_span_producer_closure_resolves_public_constructors`); and with a loud
  failure for any public id in neither category
  (`buffer_span_producer_closure_rejects_unknown_public_ids`). That evidence is
  **bounded and known enumeration-incomplete**: the walk is head-only, it
  considers only ids already in `env.globals`, and it loads only the prelude
  plus the `Buffer` and `IO` catalog packages. It does not see wrapped result
  positions, class fields — which are source-reachable producers outside
  `env.globals` — or producers in other catalog packages, and its loud-failure
  arm totalizes classification only *within* that partial enumeration.

  **So an empty result from that oracle does not entail that every span reaching
  `freeze` is host-minted, and this entry does not make that inference.**
  Calling the oracle "test-derived rather than proof" would not repair the
  implication; it would only describe an insufficient test. It is corroborating
  evidence over the fragment it covers, and no more.

  **`SEAL-2` owns the durable producer-enumeration gate**, and is deliberately
  not built here. **If this empirical seal breaks, or its future gate fails,
  `BufferFreeze` owes executable single-fault and overlap differential
  coverage.** The narrowing guards remain correct defense-in-depth, covered at
  the dispatch boundary above.

  `rt_parity_native.rs::buffer_freeze_malformed_span_is_unconstructible_at_the_landed_surface`
  pins the empirical seal at the differential layer: `PrivateBufferSpan`,
  `PrivateTransferCount`, and the sealed `write_all_advance_span` must all stay
  unnameable from checked source. It pins that seal; it does not enumerate the
  producer surface.

  One premise in that pin is **verified but ungated**. `TransferCount` has no
  public producer empirically at the landed surface — every public declaration
  mentioning it consumes one, and `PrivateTransferCount` is sealed — but that is
  a grep-verified fact with no oracle behind it: the landed oracle covers
  `BufferSpan` only, so nothing would catch a future public `TransferCount`
  producer. That gap is also `SEAL-2`'s, and the pin is retained as defense in
  depth rather than as a load-bearing premise.

  The same empirical seal is what makes `FsWriteAt`'s `buffer_start`/`length`
  narrowings source-unreachable; only its `file_offset` is source-controllable.
- overlap-fault shape in the differential: the coincident fault is a **rights**
  fault, not a liveness one. Constructing a closed-but-still-referenced
  resource requires escaping it from its bracket, and escaping a second
  `Resource` through a bracket currently fails native lowering
  (`OrientedSubcontinuationPlanV1: checked Runtime frame marker was consumed
  more than once`). That is a pre-existing native lowering limitation, outside
  RT-PARITY's scope and reported rather than worked around; the liveness shape
  is covered at the dispatch boundary, and the rights fault discriminates the
  same narrowing-order property.
- why: exact public error identity is part of interpreter/native parity. A
  sentinel that happens to fail later is not equivalent to rejecting the
  malformed integer at the consuming operation's narrowing boundary.

## PR-B. Positioned bounds and tail capping

### buffer-io/positioned-transfer-bounds

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-F-CAP-41 Phase 2 — §38 contract locked;
  capacity-carrying checked handle and derived admission not implemented**
- spec: `38 §1.7.1/§1.7.2`; PX8-T D3/AC3; PX8-F-CAP-41 Phase 1
- engine matrix: run every row independently on `interpreter` and `native`.
  Each engine must satisfy the exact result and absence observations directly
  against `38 §1.7.1`; equality between engines is not an oracle.
- given: in each row, acquire a fresh capacity-`8` `BufferHandle` only through
  `withBuffer 8`, use a fresh live readable positioned file, record the
  post-acquisition `FsReadAt` trace baseline, and use a host backend that
  records every read call from zero
- expect, absolute rows:

  | File offset | Raw `BufferWindow` | Exact result | Private `FsReadAt` / host read |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `0` | `(start = 8, length = 4)` | `Ok ReadEof` | none / none |
  | `0` | `(start = 9, length = 4)` | `Err InvalidBounds` | none / none |
  | `-1` | `(start = 8, length = 4)` | `Err InvalidOffset` | none / none |
  | `-1` | `(start = 9, length = 4)` | `Err InvalidOffset` | none / none |

- expect: the closed-endpoint row is derived checked behavior: no private
  `FsReadAt` operation is emitted, the canonical `FsReadAt` event count does
  not advance from its post-acquisition baseline, and the host backend is not
  visited. The same absence observations hold for every early-error row.
- expect: start `6` with positive length `4` is capped to the available tail
  and a positive transfer is at most `2`; offset-plus-effective overflow is
  `InvalidOffset` before host I/O
- expect: neither read nor write mutates a hidden file cursor; a later call's
  result depends on its explicit offset
- phase boundary: Phase 1 locks the sealed, acquisition-bound `BufferHandle`
  and these result/absence observations in the spec and conformance corpus.
  It does not make either engine row GREEN: Phase 2 must implement the handle,
  migrate the checked consumers, and make the real derived `readAt` route reach
  these rows. A hand-fed capacity or result, a direct host call, or an
  interpreter result used as the native expectation cannot discharge them.
- why: the first two rows separate the inclusive capacity boundary from an
  out-of-range start. The last two rows prove that host-width offset admission
  precedes both the derived closed-endpoint result and window bounds admission.
  Treating the closed endpoint as invalid, consulting caller-forgeable
  capacity, invoking the host for a zero-effective request, or inspecting the
  window before the offset makes at least one exact result or trace red.

## Clean-room provenance for PR-B

These rows were independently derived from the exact Phase-1
`38 §1.7.1/§1.7.2` candidate, the existing PX8 seed, and the Steward/spec-leader
assignment. No `local/refs/` implementation, permissive reference, or copyleft
reference was consulted. The originality scan is therefore not applicable;
this is a recorded no-reference-contact statement.

## PR-C. Failures never masquerade as progress

### buffer-io/transfer-failures-remain-errors

- status: **RED-UNTIL-REMAINING-PR-C-ARMS — partial reaching evidence only**
- spec: `38 §1.7.2`; PX8-T D2/AC3
- GREEN arms: `Closed`, `ResourceKindMismatch`, `RightNotHeld`, and
  `BufferLimit` independently reach in
  `effect_v1::tests::bounded_positioned_io_reaches_progress_mismatch_and_ordered_bindings`;
  `Interrupted` independently reaches after a successful prefix in
  `px8f_write_partition::checked_write_all_reaches_full_short_zero_progress_flip_and_error_prefixes`.
- non-GREEN arms: `MalformedResource`, invalid offset/window/bounds
  (`InvalidBounds`), allocation failure distinct from `BufferLimit`, unsupported
  nonblocking posture, and host-I/O failure distinct from the reaching
  `Interrupted` identity have no independently-reaching evidence on this SHA.
- given: independently reach `Closed`, `MalformedResource`,
  `ResourceKindMismatch`, `RightNotHeld`, invalid offset/window/bounds,
  buffer-limit/allocation failure, unsupported nonblocking posture, host I/O
  failure, and `Interrupted`
- expect: every arm remains an error carrying its own identity; none constructs
  `ReadProgress` or `WriteProgress`; `Interrupted` is not silently retried or
  reclassified as short success
- expect: `WouldBlock` is absent from the PX8 progress vocabulary; the PX12
  asynchronous seam cannot be accepted as a PX8 status
- why: this closes the error side of the partition. Positive-short success does
  not license a generic fallback that turns unrelated failures into progress.

## SP-A. A span is bound to one exact buffer acquisition

The Phase-1 matrix retains one independent cell per engine; interpreter/native
equality is not an oracle. The complete interpreter cells for SP-A freeze,
SP-A write, SP-B, and SP-C are GREEN. None of their native cells is witnessed:
SP-A freeze has one executing both-engine arm, but it is `#[ignore]`d and a
forced run fails during native object emission at
[[RT-COMPMATCH-TREE-SCRUTINEE]]; SP-A write, SP-B, and SP-C have no executing
native arm. The four native cells therefore remain explicitly blocked on that
live Runtime node, not on the merged [[RT-NATIVE-FNSPLIT]].

The native route-1 mechanism still has supporting, non-cell evidence: SP-A
freeze drives the full native foreign-rejection path; a distinct-token native
lowering fixture proves `FsWriteAt` marshals the sixth `span_origin` request
field rather than substituting the target; and the shared host dispatcher
proves both consumers reject before byte exposure or backend writes. This
evidence makes the landed mechanism auditable, but does not present an
interpreter fallback or a composed proof as completion of the blocked native
cells. The targeted `rt_span_prov_native` run passes five interpreter tests and
ignores the sole both-engine arm; forcing that arm fails with
`ComputationalMatch: tree-producing match scrutinee is not Bool or a
constructor`. The native cells turn GREEN only after the exact programs run.

The exact foreign-acquisition result is the existing
`ResourceError.InvalidBounds`, as locked by `38 §1.7.1`. It is the same public
identity used when a span's numeric window is not current for its target
buffer: both reject one invalid span-to-buffer relation without exposing the
constructor-private acquisition binding.

### buffer-io/foreign-span-freeze-rejected-absolute

- status: **PARTIAL — interpreter GREEN; native
  BLOCKED-ON-RT-COMPMATCH-TREE-SCRUTINEE
  ([[RT-COMPMATCH-TREE-SCRUTINEE]])**
- spec: `38 §1.7.1`; PX8-SPAN-PROV AC-3
- engine matrix:
  - `interpreter`: GREEN; the Phase-2 interpreter half witnesses the complete
    foreign/own-span pair
  - `native`: BLOCKED; the only executing both-engine arm is `#[ignore]`d, and
    forcing it fails at native object emission under
    [[RT-COMPMATCH-TREE-SCRUTINEE]] before the native observation
- evidence:
  `crates/ken-cli/tests/rt_span_prov_native.rs::sp_a_foreign_span_freeze_rejects_own_span_succeeds_on_both_engines`
- given: acquire distinct capacity-`8` buffers A and B; use successful
  `readAt` calls to install the same numeric live window `[2, 6)` in both while
  storing distinct bytes `AAAA` in A and `BBBB` in B; retain the host-minted
  `span_a` and `span_b`
- expect, foreign arm: `freeze B span_a` returns
  `Err InvalidBounds`; it returns no `Bytes` value and therefore exposes
  none of B's bytes
- expect, own-span control: `freeze B span_b` returns exactly `BBBB`
- why: start, length, capacity, and live-window shape are equal in both arms;
  only acquisition identity differs. A numeric-only admission accepts the
  foreign arm and returns `BBBB`, while an always-reject implementation fails
  the own-span control.

### buffer-io/foreign-span-write-rejected-before-backend

- status: **PARTIAL — interpreter GREEN; native
  BLOCKED-ON-RT-COMPMATCH-TREE-SCRUTINEE
  ([[RT-COMPMATCH-TREE-SCRUTINEE]])**
- spec: `38 §1.7.1`; PX8-SPAN-PROV AC-3
- engine matrix:
  - `interpreter`: GREEN; run the complete given/expect pair with a fresh
    recording destination per arm
  - `native`: BLOCKED; there is no executing native arm for this exact program;
    the first reaching both-engine control fails under
    [[RT-COMPMATCH-TREE-SCRUTINEE]]
- evidence:
  - interpreter foreign arm:
    `rt_span_prov_native::sp_a_foreign_span_write_rejects_before_backend_interp`
  - interpreter own-span control:

  - supporting native seam:

    distinct-token sixth-field fixture, plus
    `ken_host::effect_v1::tests::foreign_acquisition_span_rejects_on_both_consumers_before_bytes_or_backend`
- given: the same A/B pair and spans as
  `foreign-span-freeze-rejected-absolute`, a live writable positioned file, and
  a backend that records every write call and its bytes
- expect, foreign arm: `writeAt file 0 B span_a` returns
  `Err InvalidBounds`; the backend records zero writes and the destination
  remains byte-for-byte empty
- expect, own-span control: `writeAt file 0 B span_b` returns `Wrote 4`; the
  backend records exactly one call at offset `0` with exactly `BBBB`, and the
  destination contains exactly `BBBB`
- why: the rejecting arm observes both the exact public error and absence of a
  backend effect. Checking provenance after slicing or after host I/O can
  return the right error while still corrupting the destination; the call-count
  and byte assertions make that bug red.

## SP-B. Span validity has a locked, observable precedence

### buffer-io/span-validity-follows-host-width-and-precedes-host-effects

- status: **PARTIAL — interpreter GREEN; native
  BLOCKED-ON-RT-COMPMATCH-TREE-SCRUTINEE
  ([[RT-COMPMATCH-TREE-SCRUTINEE]])**
- spec: `38 §1.7.1`; PX8-SPAN-PROV AC-1/AC-2/AC-3
- engine matrix:
  - `interpreter`: GREEN; run every arm independently
  - `native`: BLOCKED; there is no executing native arm for these exact
    programs; the first reaching both-engine control fails under
    [[RT-COMPMATCH-TREE-SCRUTINEE]]
- evidence:
  - validity/no-effect arms:
    `rt_span_prov_native::sp_b_foreign_and_stale_window_reject_with_no_effect_interp`
  - host-width precedence:
    `rt_span_prov_native::sp_b_host_width_offset_precedes_provenance_interp`
- given: retain `span_a = [2, 6)` from live buffer A, but install B's current
  live window as `[0, 2)`; keep B live and kind-correct, and keep the positioned
  file live, writable, and at a valid offset
- expect: both `freeze B span_a` and `writeAt file 0 B span_a` return
  `Err InvalidBounds`; freeze returns no bytes and write records zero backend
  calls
- control: with a host-minted span from B's exact acquisition that is stale
  only because a later `readAt` changed B's current live window, both consumers
  return the existing `InvalidBounds`; the write backend is still uncalled
- control: changing only `fileOffset` to `-1` on the foreign-span write returns
  the already-locked `InvalidOffset` at host-width admission and records zero
  backend calls
- why: these arms locate acquisition admission after the existing host-width
  gate and place the combined span-validity rejection before backend effects.
  Acquisition mismatch and stale-window invalidity intentionally share one
  public identity, so their relative internal order is not observable. The
  same-shape SP-A pair is the load-bearing acquisition discriminator.

## SP-C. Slot reuse cannot revive a span from a closed acquisition

### buffer-io/closed-span-not-revived-by-buffer-slot-reuse

- status: **PARTIAL — interpreter GREEN; native
  BLOCKED-ON-RT-COMPMATCH-TREE-SCRUTINEE
  ([[RT-COMPMATCH-TREE-SCRUTINEE]])**
- spec: `38 §1.7.1`; PX8-SPAN-PROV AC-3
- engine matrix:
  - `interpreter`: GREEN; run the complete lifecycle
  - `native`: BLOCKED; there is no executing native arm for this exact program;
    the first reaching both-engine control fails under
    [[RT-COMPMATCH-TREE-SCRUTINEE]]
- evidence:
  - complete interpreter lifecycle:
    `rt_span_prov_native::sp_c_released_span_not_revived_by_slot_reuse_interp`
  - opaque-token slot/generation proof:
    `ken_host::effect_v1::tests::released_acquisition_span_is_not_revived_by_slot_reuse`
- given: acquire capacity-`8` buffer A, install `AAAA` at `[2, 6)`, retain
  `span_old`, and release A; the test harness then acquires capacity-`8` buffer
  B in A's vacated resource-table slot, proves that the slot was reused with a
  newer acquisition generation, and installs `BBBB` at the same `[2, 6)`
  window without exposing either token component to Ken source
- expect, closed control: before reuse, applying `span_old` to the released A
  reports the existing `Closed` identity for both `freeze` and `writeAt`; no
  bytes are returned and the recording write backend is uncalled
- expect, reuse arm: after B is live, `freeze B span_old` and
  `writeAt file 0 B span_old` each return `Err InvalidBounds`; freeze
  returns no B bytes and write records zero backend calls
- expect, new-span controls: a span freshly minted by `readAt` on B freezes to
  exactly `BBBB`, and its positioned write succeeds with exactly one backend
  call carrying `BBBB`
- why: slot identity alone aliases the old and new acquisitions. Requiring the
  full acquisition identity makes release/reallocation a permanent verdict
  flip, while the fresh-span controls reject an always-stale implementation.

## Stale-disposition closure account

The seven producer reds became stale at identifiable landings: CAT-3 at
`72c2315ca`, CAT-4 as the D0–D4 corpus entered this ancestry through
`6e34371cc3`/`f71abba014`, and CP0 at `6088e0b8a`; none triggered a seed
re-adjudication. The buffer markers failed at a different known boundary:
[[RT-NATIVE-FNSPLIT]] closed `merged` on 2026-07-29 despite its contract to run
these exact native matrices and its closure promise of a conformance flip. No
mechanism re-examines a blocked disposition when its named node closes or
checks that closure against incoming markers. The cheap catch therefore
belongs at producer/node closure: enumerate dependent dispositions and require
their measured re-adjudication before closing.

## Clean-room provenance for SP-A–SP-C

These rows were independently derived from the landed `38 §1.7.1` contract,
the tracked PX8-SPAN-PROV issue/brief and Architect ruling, and the landed Ken
host/interpreter/native admission paths. No `local/refs/` implementation,
permissive reference, or copyleft reference was consulted. The originality
scan is therefore not applicable; this is a recorded no-reference-contact
statement.

## Locked `writeAll` oracle

For one constructor-private input span, `writeAll` derives structural `Nat`
fuel from the span length. It terminates and has exactly two observable result
classes:

- success only after every byte in the span has been written; and
- the first transfer error unchanged, after preserving the exact prefix written
  before that error.

If every primitive call succeeds, strict positivity and `n <= remaining` imply
that the whole span is written. Fuel exhaustion with bytes remaining is
excluded by that lemma; it is not a public error. A caller-supplied fuel value
or a result that claims success with a nonempty remainder does not conform.

## WA-A. Full writes reach whole-span success

### buffer-io/write-all-full-writes

- status: **GREEN — PX8-F derived Ken `writeAll` + Verify companion**
- spec: `38 §1.7.3`; PX8-T D4/AC4
- evidence: `px8f_write_partition::checked_write_all_reaches_full_short_zero_progress_flip_and_error_prefixes`
- given: span bytes `ABCDEFGH`, initial file offset `10`, and a real scripted
  transfer backend whose successive positive writes are `[8]`
- expect: `writeAll` returns success, the sink contains exactly `ABCDEFGH`, and
  the sole `writeAt` call uses file offset `10` and the whole span
- expect: fuel is derived from the span length and is not accepted from a
  caller
- why: this is the full-progress baseline reached through the derived Ken loop,
  not a hand-fed success value.

## WA-B. Short writes continue with exact accounting

### buffer-io/write-all-short-writes-complete

- status: **GREEN — PX8-F derived Ken `writeAll` + Verify companion**
- spec: `38 §1.7.3`; PX8-T D4/AC4
- evidence: `px8f_write_partition::checked_write_all_reaches_full_short_zero_progress_flip_and_error_prefixes`
- given: the same span and offset as WA-A, with real successive write results
  `[Wrote 3, Wrote 2, Wrote 3]`
- expect: `writeAll` returns success and the sink contains exactly `ABCDEFGH`;
  calls use file offsets `[10, 13, 15]` and non-overlapping remaining spans of
  lengths `[8, 5, 3]`
- why: treating a positive short write as complete leaves `DEFGH` unwritten;
  treating it as an error rejects. Both bugs produce the opposite verdict or a
  different structural call trace.

## WA-C. Write zero reaches `NoProgress`

### buffer-io/write-all-zero-write-is-no-progress

- status: **GREEN — PX8-F derived Ken `writeAll` + Verify companion**
- spec: `38 §1.7.2/§1.7.3`; PX8-T D2/D4/AC3/AC4
- evidence: `px8f_write_partition::checked_write_all_reaches_full_short_zero_progress_flip_and_error_prefixes`
- given: the same span and offset, with real successive write results
  `[Wrote 3, syscall-zero]`
- expect: `writeAll` returns `Err NoProgress`; the sink contains exactly `ABC`;
  no third host call occurs and the remaining span is not reported written
- why: mapping zero to success falsely completes or loops without decreasing.
  This case reaches the zero-returning host branch and observes both the named
  error and exact prefix.

## WA-D. First transfer error preserves the exact prefix

### buffer-io/write-all-transfer-error-preserves-prefix

- status: **GREEN — PX8-F derived Ken `writeAll` + Verify companion**
- spec: `38 §1.7.3`; PX8-T D4/AC4
- evidence: `px8f_write_partition::checked_write_all_reaches_full_short_zero_progress_flip_and_error_prefixes`
- given: the same span and offset, with real successive results
  `[Wrote 2, Err E]`
- expect: `writeAll` returns the same first error `E` unchanged; the sink
  contains exactly `AB`; exactly two host calls occur, at offsets `[10, 12]`;
  no byte after the exact successful prefix is claimed written
- why: a loop that restarts, rewrites the error, discards the prefix, or retries
  after error differs observably. This is the indirection case: the failure is
  reached only after one successful recursive step.

## KM-A. Buffer token to file-only consumer mismatches

### buffer-io/buffer-token-rejected-by-file-consumer

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R**
- spec: `38 §1.7`; PX8-T D5/AC5; ADR 0021, “Host catalog and
  fail-visible errors”
- given: a real token minted by `BufferAllocate`, supplied to
  `FsHandleMetadata`
- expect: `ResourceKindMismatch { expected: FsHandle, actual: Buffer }`
- control: a real `FsHandle` token supplied to `FsHandleMetadata` succeeds
- why: both tokens are live and well-formed, so `MalformedResource` is not an
  admissible substitute.

## KM-B. File token to buffer-only consumer mismatches

### buffer-io/file-token-rejected-by-buffer-consumer

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R**
- spec: `38 §1.7`; PX8-T D5/AC5; ADR 0021, “Host catalog and
  fail-visible errors”
- given: a real token minted by `FsOpen`, supplied to `BufferFreeze`
- expect: `ResourceKindMismatch { expected: Buffer, actual: FsHandle }`
- control: a real Buffer token supplied to `BufferFreeze` succeeds
- why: reversing expected and actual produces the other exact payload. Together
  KM-A/KM-B fail a swapped-field implementation while the same-kind controls
  prevent an always-mismatch route from passing.

## BL-A. Per-buffer limit is deterministic

### buffer-io/per-buffer-capacity-limit

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R admission + PX8-F `withBuffer`**
- spec: `38 §1.7`; PX8-T D5/AC5
- given: checked/native plan limits `{ per_buffer_max_capacity: 8,
  invocation_max_live_capacity: 12 }`
- expect: one positive-capacity buffer of `8` is admitted; capacity `9` is
  rejected as a buffer-limit/allocation error; capacity zero is rejected
- expect: changing an environment variable cannot alter either verdict
- why: this isolates the per-buffer bound while total live capacity stays
  within `12`.

## BL-B. Invocation-wide live limit is deterministic

### buffer-io/invocation-live-capacity-limit

- status: **RED-UNTIL-PX8-R admission + PX8-F `withBuffer`**
- spec: `38 §1.7`; PX8-T D5/AC5
- given: the same plan as BL-A; keep one live buffer of capacity `8`, then
  request a second buffer
- expect: capacity `4` is admitted and makes total live capacity `12`; capacity
  `5` is rejected; after the first buffer settles, capacity `5` is admitted
- expect: the plan, not process environment, supplies both limits
- why: all individual capacities are below the per-buffer maximum, so only the
  invocation-wide live-capacity accounting varies.

## Cross-case, verdict-flip, and reachability sweep

- **D1 is non-degenerate on every locked axis.** RB-A/RB-B vary only presence
  of the required Buffer role; RB-A/RB-C vary only the role labels; RB-A/RB-D
  vary only tuple order; RB-A/RB-E vary only whether the two bindings inhabit
  one event or independent atoms; and RB-A/RB-F vary only the Buffer identity.
  RB-A/RB-O vary only one duplicated Buffer tuple.
  A presence-only, role-blind, map-shaped, cross-event-unioning, or
  identity-blind, set-shaped validator accepts its respective negative. The
  correct route accepts only RB-A.
- **Static and runtime failure phases are distinct.** RB-H–RB-K and RB-N alter
  the exported descriptor shape, required plan set, canonical plan order, or
  alphabet closure and therefore reject before `T`/hash emission. RB-B–RB-F
  and RB-O leave the static body byte-identical to RB-A; their runtime
  observations fail at event validation or external-Ward discharge, without
  changing the already-emitted canonical `T` bytes or hash.
- **Plan specialization is controlled.** RB-A retains the full two-resource
  inventory; RB-L's non-degenerate buffer-only `Σ` emits one filtered plan;
  RB-M retains both resources but removes only metadata/write operations absent
  from its read-only `Σ`; RB-N changes only the insertion of one unreachable
  operation and flips acceptance under I3.
- **D4 reaches four different producer branches.** WA-A–WA-D invoke the real
  derived Ken loop over a scripted host backend. They do not construct a final
  `writeAll` result, call a helper that bypasses `writeAt`, or infer success from
  suite greenness. The short, zero, and error arms are observed after the host
  result crosses the real runtime-to-Ken projection.
- **The `writeAll` experiments are controlled.** Input bytes, initial offset,
  buffer span, plan, and loop are identical; only the host result sequence
  varies. Prefix bytes and call offsets make progress accounting observable
  independently of the final verdict.
- **The mismatch pair reverses a real production kind.** KM-A/KM-B use tokens
  minted by the two real acquisition paths, not fabricated encodings. Their
  same-kind controls must succeed. A malformed token has its separate existing
  `MalformedResource` route and cannot satisfy either case.
- **PR-B is absolute, ordered, and independently reaching.** Every row runs
  once per engine from a fresh acquisition, file, trace, and recording backend.
  The closed-endpoint and out-of-range rows hold all inputs fixed except
  `start = 8` versus `start = 9`, so treating the inclusive endpoint as invalid
  flips the exact result. The two invalid-offset rows hold offset fixed at
  `-1` while exercising each downstream outcome; returning `ReadEof` or
  `InvalidBounds` instead proves that the wrapper inspected the window before
  host-width admission. The no-event/no-host assertions separately catch a
  route that returns the right value only after emitting or dispatching a
  forbidden positive read.
- **The provenance experiments are absolute and controlled at their recorded
  status.** SP-A freeze holds capacity, numeric window, live-window shape, and
  operation fixed while changing only the span's originating acquisition; its
  foreign arm rejects and its own-span arm succeeds on the interpreter. Its
  ignored both-engine arm fails at native object emission when forced. SP-A
  write, SP-B, and SP-C run their complete absolute cells on the interpreter
  but have no executing native arm; all four native cells remain explicitly
  blocked by [[RT-COMPMATCH-TREE-SCRUTINEE]], not inferred from composed
  evidence. SP-B fixes the
  mismatch's position between host-width admission and live-window/backend
  work. SP-C forces actual slot reuse and changes the generation, so a check on
  slot or numeric span alone fails while a full-acquisition check passes.
- **The provenance failures expose no bytes and perform no writes.** A matching
  error returned after a freeze result or backend write is not conforming.
  In each GREEN cell, SP-A–SP-C assert the negative observation as well as the
  error value, while their own-span controls prove the observation channel is
  live.
- **Reachability gates are explicit.** Runtime owns observation production,
  including `Buffer`, both acquisition paths, positioned host operations,
  progress/error production, mismatch, and admission enforcement. Verify owns
  the static export projection. Foundation owns the landed `withBuffer` and
  surface sums, plus the derived-Ken `writeAll`; PX8-F-CAP-41 Phase 2 owns the
  capacity-carrying `BufferHandle`, consumer migration, and ordered PR-B
  admission needed to make the new rows reachable. The external Ward project
  alone owns monitor execution and verdicts; they stay delegated and out of
  Ken. Until each named producer and consumer lands, its cases remain RED
  contract roots rather than current green claims.
- **The schema collapse is controlled, not compatibility.** RB-G reuses the
  landed checked `px7f_export_resource` producer and pins its one intentional
  direct-body rebaseline. Its independent checked no-acquire control retains the
  pinned canonical hash because it has no resource-lifetime body. A schema-unit
  comparison or newly invented fixture cannot replace either producer.
