# Current briefing (live — read this first on every Steward resume)

> ## HOW TO READ THIS FILE, AND WHEN TO DISTRUST IT
>
> **`origin/main` outranks this file, always.** If anything below tells you to
> do something `git fetch origin` shows as landed, **this file is stale and the
> repository is right.** Re-read fresh, in this order:
>
> 1. `git fetch origin && git rev-parse origin/main`
> 2. the LIVE block below — **only** the LIVE block
> 3. the open tasks (do not re-derive priority from memory)
> 4. for what is HELD, DEFERRED, or WHOSE it is: **the node**
>    (`docs/program/issues/*.md`), its operative block — never this file
>
> **This file is a resume POINTER, not an archive. Git is the archive.** When a
> window closes its block is **deleted**, not demoted to a "superseded" section —
> a superseded block left in the file gets read by someone, eventually.

> ### REWRITTEN 2026-07-26 ~19:4xZ — 2866 lines → this. Read the bound.
>
> The prior content (~2700 lines of windows stacked back to 2026-07-21) is at blob
> **`c26ee67f29d42690f461d43fe15e21c2202a31df`** — `git show c26ee67f`. Nothing was
> lost; it was archived to git with this pointer.
>
> **HONEST BOUND ON THE AUDIT: I did not read all 2866 lines.** I read every
> heading, the blocks claiming to be authoritative, and then **scanned** the
> remainder for sole-source markers, decision ids, held items, and preserved refs.
> ⇒ **That is a scan, not an exhaustive audit**, and its surface was my own idea of
> what "load-bearing" looks like. A reader who needs something from before
> 2026-07-26 should assume it is in `c26ee67f`, not that it was considered.
>
> **What the scan found is why the rewrite was worth doing: two blocks that
> advertised themselves as authoritative were WRONG** (see *Corrections*), and a
> hand-maintained list of 6 preserved refs when origin held **26**.

## LIVE

> **Re-arm the watchdog on every resume** — it is process-local and dies with
> every MCP restart. Builds allowed, targeted only, never `--workspace`.

> ### RESUME HERE — state at 2026-08-10 ~07:4xZ. `main` = `bebe1a79`.
>
> **BOTH open Architect questions are ANSWERED. Nothing is waiting on the
> Architect. The two things they gated are now mine and are DONE below.**
>
> #### The 95-minute stall was a STRANDED COMPOSER, and it is the finding
>
> The Architect posted nothing between 05:42 and 07:22 while **four items**
> queued behind it — two merge Decisions and two design questions — blocking
> three of four lanes. It was not dead, not compacted, not busy.
> **`tmux capture-pane` showed twelve `[Pasted Content N chars]` blocks sitting
> unsubmitted in its composer.** Every mention since 05:42, including my own two
> from minutes earlier, had been pasted and never entered. **One bare `Enter`
> cleared it and all four items were answered within 15 minutes.**
>
> **The discriminator is the DIM attribute, and it earned its keep in both
> directions.** `capture-pane -p -e` and look at the composer's escape codes:
> `ESC[2m` is a dim placeholder (idle, leave alone); anything else is real
> stranded input. The Architect's was `ESC[38;5;6m` — cyan, real.
> **A full-fleet sweep then flagged `moot-adversary` and
> `moot-runtime-implementer` as apparent strands and BOTH were false** — their
> composers were `ESC[2m` dim, showing the *last submitted prompt*. Without the
> attribute test I would have re-submitted a `/compact` and a stale
> instruction into two healthy seats.
>
> **A seat's convo status line is not liveness.** The Architect's still read
> `ready — DS-9 D1 ... publisher routed` throughout, which was true, 95 minutes
> stale, and indistinguishable from working. `get_activity` is the instrument
> that saw it: last event 05:42 against a queue that kept growing.
>
> #### Architect ruling 1 — c1: NO (`evt_15b9acbfs9tty`). RECUT ISSUED.
>
> Absence of `checked_core.runtime_symbols` is **not** a sound discriminator: a
> package-backed package whose metadata omits the role record erases to the same
> `None` as a synthetic program, so treating `None` as synthetic re-admits the
> exact case `c1` must refuse. Provenance goes in the **construction API**, not
> in the IR.
>
> **Recut posted at `evt_ydks95x7mmtp`. The cut: reset to `24995e5e`, discard
> `9b55a421`.** That commit is exactly 4 files, `+101/-82`, and is entirely the
> inert threading — **so the ruling's "remove the 77 inert builder parameters"
> is discharged by the reset, not by a 77-site edit.** Kept: `cdb800a8` (the
> production fail-closed gate, which introduced `native_authority_for_program`)
> and `24995e5e`. Stack base `8e2883b0` is on `main`.
>
> **I verified the prescription is buildable at the layer named, which is the
> check I failed twice on this slice.** `legacy_prelude()` is `pub(crate)` in
> `ken-runtime` with **no cross-crate callers** — the two `ken-elaborator`
> integration-test hits are doc-comment prose. All 63 real call sites are
> in-crate and already `#[cfg(test)]` territory. Had one been cross-crate,
> deliverable 2's `#[cfg(test)]` entrypoint would have been unbuildable as
> written, exactly as the previous two relays were.
>
> **Sized as ONE turn, not sliced:** the 38 reds clear only when the synthetic
> entrypoint lands, so a production-only first slice would be an unmergeable red
> increment.
>
> #### Architect ruling 2 — List recursion: YES (`evt_6ysrp62e4zayg`)
>
> The obstruction extends to `List`-carried recursion. **DS-9 `D3`+ unbounded
> Json folds over arrays and objects are BLOCKED**; `D2`'s standalone
> `List Char` recursion is **not** and is not reopened.
>
> **The dependency is SLICE-level and is deliberately NOT in DS-9's
> `depends_on`** — putting it there would mark the whole node blocked, which is
> false. Recorded in DS-9's body instead. `KERNEL-RECURSIVE-RESULT-SURFACE` now
> carries `blocks: [DS-9]` as documentation; `gen-progress.sh` reads
> `depends_on`, so it will not render as a graph edge, and that is intended.
>
> #### KERNEL-RECURSIVE-RESULT-SURFACE is now a THREE-way blocker
>
> Sized `M` (was `TBD`) and made shovel-ready so the operator's 11:30Z call is a
> **pure priority call**. It blocks `nested-size-uses-lift`,
> `nested-dependent-motive-uses-lift`, **and now DS-9 `D3`+** — Foundation's
> next work. **Its `D0` does not depend on what holds its parent:**
> `KERNEL-NESTED-IND` is active solely on Runtime-blocked `AC-K12`, and a Spec
> contract about surface spelling is not a function of `AC-K12`. `D0` also
> consumes a spec-enclave seat, not one of the capped build lanes.
>
> #### Publisher state
>
> **DS-9 `D2` exact `ee6773b0` is IN THE PUBLISHER as PR #1775** (Decision
> `dec_7qw0k1q4rv6bc` resolved 07:22:20Z). M1-M3 done: two paths matching the
> declared scope, no cited sources, intersection empty. **NOT yet merged — do
> not record it as landed until M6 blob-verifies it.**
>
> **`CI-L1-EXECUTING-COVER` exact `bfac3f6f` is APPROVED and QUEUED behind it**
> (`dec_29bgfg9pep70y`, Architect APPROVE at `evt_6jwkyynk3rqer`). Six paths,
> intersection empty, verified.
>
> #### New node framed this window
>
> **`CONF-EVAL-COMPUTED-BOOL-ELIM`** — frame at
> `docs/program/wp/CONF-EVAL-COMPUTED-BOOL-ELIM.md`, owner **spec-enclave**,
> size **S**, `depends_on: [CI-L1-EXECUTING-COVER]`, `status: draft` **only**
> because of that dependency. **Flip to `ready` the moment CI-L1 merges.**
>
> This is where `D5`'s five phantom ids landed. CV judgment `evt_2ah01fn9v4ev3`:
> the family belongs in the matrix but under **`conformance/runtime/evaluation/`**,
> not `surface/numbers/`, because `eq_int`/`leq_int` are replaceable witnesses.
> `legacy-add-sub-mul-retired` is **closed as decorative**.
>
> **I measured the fact that makes the family load-bearing, and neither report
> contained it.** In `eval.rs`'s `elim_reduce` the two scrutinee arms derive the
> method index by **independent routes**: the `Ctor` arm looks the constructor
> up via `globals.constructor(ctor_id)`; the `Bool` arm hardcodes
> `let k = if b { 0 } else { 1 }`, correct **only** because `data Bool = True |
> False` declares in that order. Change the declared order and one arm follows,
> the other does not. **The computed-versus-literal agreement observation is the
> only thing that could catch it**, and a flipped repair is strictly worse than
> the original bug — it returns the wrong branch where the original left a
> visible stuck term, so `can-no-stuck-closed-ground` would miss it too.
>
> #### Still owed to me
>
> Runtime `c2` returns **before** assignment stating its `AC-K12` relationship
> (two Kernel seats idle behind that criterion).

> ### RESUME HERE — earlier state at 2026-08-10 ~06:2xZ. `main` = `8e2883b0`.
>
> Publisher queue EMPTY. **Two code merges landed this window, both CI green.**
>
> - **DS-9 `D1`** — exact `6675ff54`, PR #1770, `main` `258336bf`. Both paths
>   blob-verified. **The declaration DS-9 was stood down for on 2026-07-27 now
>   elaborates on `main`.** Merged as an **accepted partial** under
>   `merge-policy.md`: foundation-leader had said "no merge Decision until
>   D2-D7", and had already started `D2` on top of it, which made it the floor
>   rather than a candidate. Node stays `active`.
> - **RT `D1b-role-b`** — exact `7e918bdf`, PR #1771, `main` `8e2883b0`. Four
>   paths blob-verified from the declared merge-base, count checked.
>
> **Slice `c` is CUT IN TWO and `c1` is assigned** (`evt_6z7wf6dw94cym`);
> `c2` returns to me before assignment and must state its `AC-K12`
> relationship, because two Kernel seats are idle behind that criterion.
>
> **OPEN, not mine to chase: Architect question `evt_6mbzn0y6jh232`.** Does
> `KERNEL-RECURSIVE-RESULT-SURFACE`'s block extend to `List`-carried
> recursion? `List` is `Nil | Cons a (List a)` — structurally the recursive
> carrier the ruling named, and `JsonArray : List Json → Json` is DS-9's whole
> recursion surface. **If yes, DS-9's codec deliverables (`D3`+) are not
> writable and DS-9 owes a `depends_on` on a node that is `draft`, unframed,
> size TBD.** `D2` is unaffected; Foundation told to keep going.
>
> ### THREE LANES as of ~07:1xZ. `main` = `d32f8a0c`.
>
> - **Foundation** — DS-9 `D2` (`CursorOps (List Char)` + `CursorLaws`).
> - **Verify** — `CI-L1-EXECUTING-COVER` **RELEASED 06:45Z**, anchor
>   `evt_4g93v1m7m630n`, thread `thr_3p2k2nj67wc1p`. The lane opened because
>   **Runtime went held**, not because anything was reversed.
> - **Runtime** — `c1` **HELD RED at WIP `9b55a421`, not working.** Awaiting an
>   Architect ruling plus a Steward recut plus a fresh authoring turn
>   (implementer hit a context limit).
>
> **The operator's queued item 1 is MOOT in one direction** — DS-9 and
> `CI-L1-EXECUTING-COVER` are both running. Present it as resolved-by-events.
>
> ### `D5` FOUND FIVE MORE PHANTOM ROW IDS ON ITS FIRST RUN
>
> Ruled at `evt_4ge8k5v4kt1kn`. The new checker reds on five pre-existing
> claims whose ids exist in **no** `conformance/` seed — four in
> `crates/ken-interp/tests/elim_bool_dispatch_acceptance.rs`
> (`elim-reduce-computed-bool-{true-branch,false-branch,vs-literal-bool-agree,
> via-leq-int}`) and one in `crates/ken-interp/tests/f2f3_acceptance.rs`
> (`legacy-add-sub-mul-retired`). Same class as `sec61`, now measured.
>
> **Ruled: retire the five as cover claims** (drop the `/// surface/<id>` form,
> keep the prose, touch no assertion). **Do NOT narrow `D5`'s population** --
> shrinking a checker until it passes is weakening a probe to make it green.
> **Do NOT author `conformance/` rows** -- that is the spec enclave and CV's
> lane, out of scope by ownership. **Verify owes a Finding** with per-id
> judgment on whether a row should exist; I route the residual.
>
> ### RUNTIME `c1` — three Steward rulings, then a THIRD stop that is mine
>
> **Stop 3 (`evt_jrzrvbxqs57t`): my condition (c) was not implementable.**
> Threading authority reached **77** callers, not 38, and attaches **nothing**
> -- the gate reads
> `RuntimeProgram.erased_core.metadata.checked_core.runtime_symbols`, proven by
> five unused-parameter warnings. Attaching legacy roles then trades
> `MissingRoleRecord` for `MetadataInconsistent` because all five synthetic
> fixtures have empty `data_metadata`. **Second time I named a mechanism
> without checking the data path.** Three stops on one slice is the WIP-audit
> signal: **the cut was mine and the recut is mine.**
>
> Refused: weakening agreement on empty `data_metadata` (a gate that switches
> off on inputs it cannot satisfy is not a gate); minting checked-package
> provenance. **Deferred, not rejected:** fabricating 65-role authority across
> five fixtures -- heavy, drift-prone, and built to satisfy a gate whose scope
> is the open question.
>
> **Triage discharged condition (a):** all 38 synthetic, reaching five
> `#[cfg(test)]` fixture literals; **zero from `CheckedCorePackage`/erasure**,
> so no checked package is excused.
>
> All in `thr_1wn4ydb4kjqxt`. **Do not re-litigate them; do check they were
> followed.**
>
> **1. Sibling substitution (`evt_2q5h3mwnd7x7h`).** ~18 roster roles sit in
> families with same-family nullary siblings (`IOError` has 11); both
> roster-wide loops check provenance and family-uniqueness, exactly what a
> sibling substitution preserves. **Ruled:** decode-side fingerprint check
> (package semantic fingerprint equals `core_semantic_hash`) **plus** a
> test-side roster-wide `assert_eq!` against `CanonicalRuntimeRoles::all()`.
> **Rejected** widening the artifact to carry canonical role identity — that
> buys down forgery on an in-process path, which is the safety-of-`main` trap.
> They must state which control covers which failure: the fingerprint catches
> stale and tampered records and **misses a consistently mis-produced one**;
> the test catches exactly that.
> **The stop was my relay error** — the Adversary proposed a *test* loop, I
> wrote it as decode-side validation, and Runtime correctly measured it
> unbuildable there (erasure sees only `CheckedCorePackage`, symbols are a
> set, no canonical `GlobalId`s).
>
> **2. The 38 red tests (`evt_6kkvrazak8adk`).** `ken-runtime --lib` went
> 800/38 because 38 synthetic `RuntimeProgram`s inherited the implicit fallback
> `c1` deleted. **Ruled:** explicit test-only legacy authority. **Rejected**
> narrowing the gate — no provenance marker exists, so it would reopen
> authority by convention and roll back `c1`'s own contract. Four conditions:
> **(a) TRIAGE the 38 before editing** — "mostly `object_linker_packaging`"
> hides a remainder, and any *checked* package among them is a production
> finding, not a test fixup; **(b)** the constructor is unreachable from
> production, **proved** — `cfg(test)` alone is not evidence and a zero from
> `cargo check` is not proof; **(c)** explicit at **each** site, no blanket
> default or silent helper, which would rebuild the fallback under a new name;
> **(d)** report the 38 as an **enumeration with classification**, not a count.
> **The 38 is the blast-radius measurement and is `c1`'s most valuable
> output** — it only exists because the gate is fail-closed.
>
> **3. The cut (`evt_6z7wf6dw94cym`).** Slice `c` split: `c1` a fail-closed
> contract that merges independently, `c2` semantic admission. **`c2` returns
> to me before assignment and must state its `AC-K12` relationship** — that
> criterion is Runtime-owned and two Kernel seats are idle behind it.
>
> **M6 WAS UNDER-VERIFYING and is fixed.** It said `git diff --name-only
> <SHA>^ <SHA>` — the last commit only. DS-9 `D1` was two commits, so it
> enumerated one of two declared paths and printed a confident `MATCH` while
> the package went unchecked. No error, no empty output. Now enumerates from
> the declared merge-base and checks the path count against the ring's scope.
>
> **`CI-ASSERTIONLESS-L1` MERGED** at exact `3d6622c9` (PR #1765), all three
> blobs verified. Four SHAs, three rejections, every one on the file header's
> per-row conformance-cover claim. **What landed it was dropping the claim, not
> restating it** -- the header now points at
> `.github/ignored-test-exemptions.toml` and says it makes no claim about any
> other row. Adversary notified (`evt_78ste7892zmdv`, carries code); ring
> notified (`evt_5dj0f9ps9dt1c`).
>
> **`DS-9` RELEASED TO FOUNDATION**, anchor `evt_6sb1ypxndtv4v`,
> foundation-leader confirmed `Working`. Stand-down lifted; the Architect's
> named re-encoding prohibitions still bind. Frame §7 contention caveat
> re-checked at release and clear.
>
> ### `CI-L1-EXECUTING-COVER` WIDENED — PR #1768, still ready, still NOT released
>
> Adversary finding `evt_34q2zm16a48pz` on `65a61416` gave the node a **third
> row**: `ac5_no_implicit_cross_type_coercion` has zero cover -- its `is_err()`
> is satisfied by `elaborate_decl_v1`'s inability to elaborate an un-annotated
> `fn`, which the matching-type positive control fails identically. Worse than
> `sec62`, which at least reaches its mechanism. **Ken's behaviour is correct;
> the defect is entirely in the instrument.**
>
> **Verifying it found a fourth defect that was in MY frame.** `sec61` claims
> `surface/numbers/literal-reduces-in-kernel` -- **a row id in no markdown file
> in the repo** -- while the real seed row it should serve has zero claims
> anywhere in the code tree. My §3d had supplied that mapping itself and called
> it "covers half a row". The artifact makes no such mapping.
>
> Also fixed: the §6 guardrail wrote the first `CI-ASSERTIONLESS-L1` row as a
> bare `ac5_` prefix, **forbidding the only discharge of the criterion the same
> change adds**. `D5` now buys the decidable machine check (every `///
> surface/...` id resolves to a seed heading). Re-sized S to M.
>
> **FOR THE OPERATOR, FIRST THING: I made a priority call that is yours.**
> Releasing DS-9 ahead of Verify's `CI-L1-EXECUTING-COVER` was a choice between
> two `ready` WPs, which `steward.md §3` routes to you. I made it to avoid a
> seven-hour idle lane. Grounds: Foundation has had no active work since
> 2026-07-27 while Verify has been continuously busy; DS-9 is the tier's
> acceptance test and its kernel blocker landed; and `CI-L1-EXECUTING-COVER` is
> a node I created tonight, so letting it pre-empt one waiting two weeks would
> be bad sequencing. **DS-9 yields if you disagree** -- nothing is sunk.
>
> **LANES: Runtime `D1b-role-b` (working ~50m) + Foundation `DS-9` (starting).**
> Publisher queue empty. Verify is free and its successor
> `CI-L1-EXECUTING-COVER` is framed, `ready`, and deliberately NOT released.
>
> ### TONIGHT'S MERGES: 1763-1768, plus the three before compaction
>
> ### STILL QUEUED FOR 11:30Z
>
> **Item 1 is RESOLVED BY EVENTS, not a live ask** -- the DS-9-over-CI-L1
> priority call is moot in one direction because both ran to completion.
>
> **NEW, and it is the one that matters: VERIFY HAS NO NEXT NODE, and its
> blocker is a product decision only you can make.** Once
> `CI-L1-EXECUTING-COVER` merges, Verify's only remaining node is
> `SEC1-IFC-R3`, which is correctly `draft` and genuinely unbuildable:
> `AC-R3b`/`AC-R3c` need a refutation of a `product(c, ζ)` faithfulness
> obligation, and the sole production route to `Verdict::Disproved` is gated on
> a literal `Term::IntLit` disequality (`prover.rs:298-300`). Everything else
> falls through to `emit_unknown_hole`. **`z3` is not a dependency of this
> workspace at all** -- zero hits across every manifest -- and the DAG's `V3`
> row names "classifier + Z3 + Kripke embedding". **Adding an SMT backend is a
> build/CI/licensing/throughput call, not one this node or I can make, and it
> gates the entire by-proof half of `Sec1`.** The Z3-free widening is
> separately recorded as **vacuous** -- `declare_deceq_certificate` has exactly
> one caller registering `Int`, so generalizing the prover off `IntLit` has no

> 1. The DS-9 priority call above -- resolved by events; confirm or reverse.

>    routing. Head `befc2dc4` is dated **2026-07-08**, is **not an ancestor of

> 3. **Releasing draft `KERNEL-RECURSIVE-RESULT-SURFACE`. Its case got
>    materially stronger on 2026-08-10** -- the Architect's `List` ruling makes

>    CI-enumerated exemption registry -- but **none is a tracked issue node**. I

>
> - **`+0` with set identity is the CORRECT answer, and the "not a zero" clause
>   is WITHDRAWN.** `AC-K9`, two rows above it, forbids adding any postulate or
>   trusted escape — which is exactly what `trusted_base()` counts — so a
>   nonzero delta would **fail `AC-K9`**. The AC table had already answered this
>   in the opposite direction, and the node's own still-binding list requires
>   *"zero `trusted_base()` delta with audited generator/transaction/iota TCB"*.
> - **`AC-K10` gains a mechanical control** rather than losing one. The idiom is
>   in-tree (`ds6c_intlit_elaborator_emission.rs:184`,
>   `either_catalog_package_acceptance.rs:69`): `BTreeSet` before/after in one
>   `ElabEnv`. Set identity, not `len()` — a swap reads as zero under a count.
>   An executed assertion is what makes "measured, empty" and "never measured"
>   different objects; the old row tried to do that with prose.
> - **The baseline question dissolved** — the idiom measures within one run, so
>   none of the three candidate historical SHAs is needed.
> - **The audited-code half is named, not numbered.** Enumerate the kernel paths
>   by `file:line`; ⛔ do not invent an LOC/function/file metric.

>
> Read in full and triaged. **Confirmed at the source**: the release condition
> in `planning/static_transition.rs:16513-16523` gives the reader one concrete

### The two lanes — this is the operator's cap of two

| team | node | state |
|---|---|---|
| **Kernel** | `KERNEL-NESTED-IND` | `D5` accepted partial **merged** (`5903b664`, PR #1743). Both retros in. **`D6` kicked 2026-08-09 ~22:5xZ** — a *binding* task, contract-point-4 subset only. `D7` after it |
| **Runtime** | `RT-DYNAMIC-ARM-SCALAR-MERGE` | **HELD pending an Architect design ruling** (`evt_7ek8j2wzzc3e6`). Branch FREE, tree byte-identical to `44c0ceab`, no production edit |
| **Verify** | `CI-ASSERTIONLESS-L1` | **HELD on the lane cap**, WIP preserved, `AC-2` ruling durable. **First node back in when a slot frees.** |

Neither node is closed, so no slot has freed.

> ### RUNTIME: `D1b-id` RECUT AS `D1b-role`. I WITHDREW TWO CONTROLS ON A FALSE READING; THEY ARE BACK.
>
> **The frame defect was real and mine.** `D1b-id`'s producer,
> `compiler_driver.rs:3336-3337`, runs only in the process-starter transaction.
> Runtime instrumented it: **0** producer lines on the `D5` value path, with the
> instrument confirmed present and the refusal confirmed firing. Stopping there
> instead of building an inert transport was the right call.
>
> ⇒ **But I then withdrew controls #1 and #3 as "unsatisfiable", and that was
> wrong.** Architect ruling `evt_23eb7gp8sz4an` corrects two conclusions:
>
> - *"zero `Data` rows ⇒ the `Nat` identity is absent"* — **false.** Erasure keeps
>   `declarations` minimal but copies `semantic.symbol`s into
>   `erased_core.symbols` (`erasure.rs:195-205`) and `data_metadata` into
>   `erased_core.metadata.checked_core` (`:5918-5952`), which `ir.rs:43-50` calls
>   authoritative. The probe counted **executable declarations only**. Correct
>   statement: *"`Nat` is not an executable target declaration."*
> - *"the prelude ids resolve byte-equal to legacy"* — **false.**
>   `emit_package_from_env` calls `stable_symbols_for_env` at
>   `compiler_driver.rs:2960`, which maps constructors under the
>   package-qualified parent. Through **that** table the ids yield
>   `ctor:nested_inductive_pkg::Nat::{Zero,Suc}`. Prelude **origin** and current
>   artifact **spelling** are different axes.
>
> **Both controls are restored** and become satisfiable once the producer sits on
> the generic package-emission path.
>
> **What changed in scope:** the repair is no longer a transport. It is *produce*

> **the whole `NativeProcessSymbols` population, not a Nat-only pair** — carry it
> through erasure metadata, and **require** it at package-backed native

> made structurally unreachable. Executable closure stays as-is; no `Data`
> declarations added. Cut into three accepted partials (a/b/c) in the node.
>
> **`AC-K12` IS reachable on the current architecture** — the Architect says so
> explicitly. This deliverable discharges only the first native refusal;
> verifier passage and interp/native agreement stay separate gates.
>
> **Verify stays held.** Kernel picked up `D6` at 22:52 and Runtime resumes on
> `D1b-role`, so both lanes are turning and no slot freed. **If Runtime blocks

> | `KERNEL-NESTED-IND` `D5` refusal block | a `TypeMismatch` at `nc14_data_match_lowering.rs:136` | fixed; the test was renamed; the live boundary is Runtime's |

### `DS-9` HAS SEQUENCING CONSEQUENCES — read before the next lane frees

**Foundation is idle and has been stood down since 2026-07-27 on a premise that
is now false.** DS-9's true blocker is **`KERNEL-NESTED-IND` `D5` alone**, and
DS-9 does **not** need `AC-K12` — its frame mentions native execution,
Cranelift, and the interpreter **nowhere**; it is a value type, `CursorOps`,
`encode`/`decode`, the round-trip theorem, fuel sufficiency, an acceptance test,
and Findings.

⇒ **DS-9 becomes startable when `D5` MERGES, not when `KERNEL-NESTED-IND`
CLOSES.** ⛔ Do not infer a node's blockers from its `depends_on` edge — the
edge is whole-node, the need is one deliverable. Status stays `draft` and the
flip to `ready` is mine, owed the moment `D5` lands.

**This makes the next free lane a real contest:** Verify's `CI-ASSERTIONLESS-L1`
(currently promised first) versus Foundation's DS-9. ⚠ **That is a priority call
between ready WPs, which `steward.md §3` routes to the operator, not to me.**

### OPERATOR DECISION OWED — an idle enclave under the two-lane cap

**Eleven `draft` nodes have every dependency already merged.** Six are Runtime
(a queue, fine), one is `SPEC-ALIGN-B1`, and **three belong to the spec enclave,
which is entirely idle** — `spec-leader` reports *"awaiting Steward kickoff"*,
with `spec-author` and `conformance-validator` behind it.

The cap is an operator instruction from this session, not corpus law, and
`CLAUDE.md` names the **doc** track as *the one* standing concurrency exception
— on contention-free-ness, since it touches `library/`/`agent/` not `crates/`.
`spec/` and `conformance/` are equally disjoint from `crates/`, **but the text
says one exception, so I did not extend it myself.**

⇒ **Question for the operator:** does the two-lane cap bind the spec enclave, or
is it a build-lane cap? If the latter, three unblocked nodes and three idle
seats are available now at zero `crates/` contention. ⛔ I have not kicked them.

### `RT-DYNAMIC-ARM-SCALAR-MERGE` `D1` FRAMED — `AC-2` asked the wrong question

`D0` (`evt_1ct16entsqn94`) answered all four questions at the seat **and
measured two of my own fixed inputs false**, reporting them instead of building
around them — which is what the perishable-anchor instruction asks for. The
admitted set omitted `Lowered::Int`, `Lowered::Bool`, and
`Lowered::RecursiveBackedge`; and question 3's premise that no arm produces
`RecursiveBackedge` was wrong — two produce it, a third refuses it.

**The value is `Lowered::Constructor`, `Nat::Suc` arity 1 over a `Constructor`
— an unfolded Peano chain — and it IS scalar-representable.** `StructuralNatV1`
is one `i64` and the backend already folds Peano chains at two sites.

`D1` is cut against that with **both outcomes pre-ruled** so Runtime does not
return twice: `D1a` measures the **innermost** failing link; *coverable* goes
straight to `D1b-cov` keeping the fold inductive; *genuinely dynamic* **stops**
and routes to the Architect as a representation question, and I re-cut the size.

⚠ **`AC-10` is the row that matters** — the positive control is `D0`'s seat
instrument re-run, requiring the `D5` refusal count to go 1 → 0 **and** the
arrival to be `StructuralNat`. A green `D5` test alone could pass via a
different arm admitting the `Constructor`.

⭐ **The best thing in the `D0` report is a control that FAILED.** Widening
`:15839` with `StructuralNat` printed zero — because `StructuralNat` never
reaches that match at all, so the zero would have looked exactly like the wanted
answer. Reporting that is what makes the replacement `ProcessExitStatus` witness
(50 firings, chosen from measured arrivals) trustworthy.

### The Architect caught what QA did not, on `D5`

QA approved `ec577ec0`; the Architect **rejected** it and was right.
`check_match_with_lift` selected arms with `.find(...)`, never recorded which,
and skipped the ordinary path's unused-arm rejection — so **a second arm for the
same constructor was silently accepted and dropped.** They built the
discriminator, ran it, and measured `Ok([...])` where `ReachabilityError` was
required. QA's approval was fresh but had not exercised duplicate arms.

⇒ **An accepted partial still widens acceptance, and that is reviewable.** The
partial boundary was correct; the regression was in production lockstep code the
boundary said nothing about.

### CHECK THE MODEL FOOTER ON EVERY PANE READ. A T1 SEAT WAS SILENTLY AT T3.

`kernel-implementer` was configured `gpt-5.6-sol`/medium and measured **running
`gpt-5.6-luna low`** mid-`D5` — the only seat of 28 on luna. Cause: the
"additional safety checks" modal, whose pre-selected option 1 is *retry with a
faster model*. **It had already cleared, so the footer was the only remaining
trace.**

> **Liveness and tier are independent questions.** I proved that seat was
> working by its live PID and never read what it was running — a true claim

Repair shape, validated: **hold the handback, not the code.** A downgraded seat
writes structurally correct code; what you cannot accept at T3 is its
self-reported control and mutation evidence. Reseat at a turn boundary via
`moot exec <role>` — **run it from `/workspaces/ken`, never from a worktree**,
or it derives the wrong project root and fails *after* stopping the seat.

### `D5`'s LANE SURFACE IS `AC-K12`'s STAGES. I MISREAD IT THREE TIMES.

Ruled durably in the node (`46c12adb`): **`ken-interp::eval::elim_reduce` and
`ken-elaborator/src/erasure.rs` are IN; `crates/ken-runtime` is OUT.**

> **Every time I wrote `D5`'s surface as a crate list, the omitted path turned
> out to be required by `AC-K12`'s own stages** — first `ken-elaborator/src`,
> then a false Runtime attribution, then the evaluator. A crate list written
> from the current failure site is always one consumer short of the next one.
> **The surface is every path an `AC-K12` stage traverses, minus
> `crates/ken-runtime`.** Ask which stage a consumer blocks, not whether it is
> "in the lane".

Landed `D1a`/`D3a`/`D3b`+`D4`/`D1b` — see the node. **The frame states the
PLAN, the node records EXECUTION, and the node wins**; I rerouted a ring to
already-landed `D3a` by reading the plan instead.

### `D5` progress and the wall it hit

Interpreter Nat-3 **evaluates to 3**. Erasure admits the generated support
`Elim` **only** via `all_support_origin`, arbitrary dependent motives still
rejecting — the provenance discriminator holding in both directions. Native
then refuses at `merge_scalar_operand`,
`ken-runtime/src/cranelift_backend/lowering/mod.rs:15898`. Kernel stopped
without Runtime edits, correctly.

**`RT-DYNAMIC-ARM-SCALAR-MERGE`** is filed, `D0` is closed and `D1` is framed —
see the `D1` section above. **No reverse edge**: `AC-K12`'s native stage is
Kernel's acceptance condition, not an implementation dependency, so neither node
waits on the other.

### Carried residuals — BOTH now discharged

1. **The `D1b`/`D2` polarity gate is DISCHARGED**, and this reverses what I
   wrote last checkpoint. I said the four-position controls were unmeasured and
   that whoever closed `D2` owned them. They were already measured and landed:
   `polarity_producer_covers_all_four_positions_with_independent_mutations`
   exercises all four as **non-degenerate pairs on a shared fixture**, and three
   of the four record `NonPositive` unmutated — the fail-closed direction. The
   caution was right; what it missed is that **a gate phrased as "establish
   coverage and record the result" has no owner once the deliverable it gates
   merges**, so nobody re-reads it and the frame keeps asserting the defect.
2. **`RT-TERMINAL-ALL-ELIM-AUTHORITY`'s gate re-keyed on capability** at
   `7dcda4a1`. Its answer — not released — was right but **for the wrong
   reason**: a string test could not distinguish "capability absent" from
   "relation renamed to `all_support_origins`".

### CORRECTION — the framing debt I reported last checkpoint does not exist

`RT-TERMINAL-ALL-ELIM-AUTHORITY` **is** fully framed (`D1`-`D4`, `AC-1`-`AC-8`,
forbidden list, ruled sequencing). It lives in **`docs/program/issues/`**, not
`docs/program/wp/`, and my sweep was directory-scoped. Its capability gate is
measurably not fired, so `ready`-and-held is correct. **All four successors of
the two live nodes are framed; there is no framing debt on the frontier.**
`status: ready` means framed-and-shovel-ready (§4e), which is a *different act*
from released — do not "fix" a held node's status.

> ⚠ **AMENDED 2026-08-09 ~22:2xZ — that claim was right about the FRONTIER and

### Settled this session, do not redo

- **Adversary `D7` finding — CONFIRMED and fixed at three sites.** `D7`
  re-keyed a `crates/` control from a node-closure event to the admission
  capability but swept only that one file. `RT-BODY-OCCURRENCE-PROVENANCE`'s
  `AC-5` row and `AC-D7-1` carried the phrase its own diagnosis table calls
  FALSE; `RT-JOIN-ORIGIN-ATTRIBUTION`'s frame — where the phrase was coined —
  had **both** cells event-keyed and was **not** in the report. Sweep the
  phrase, never the cited lines.
- **`CI-ASSERTIONLESS-L1` `AC-2`** — mutation site is the owner's call, the
  producer mutation is retired as uninformative (the legacy body reds first at
  its own `unwrap()`), observation-seam permitted with the anti-needle
  constraint. In the frame, blob `8336a525`.
- **The "additional safety checks" modal needs NO answer.** `kernel-leader`
  read it as a wedge and asked me to clear it; option 1 "retry with a faster
  model" is pre-selected and `Enter` would have downgraded a T1 seat mid-`D5`.
  The lesson was filed Steward-only; **moved to `agent/memory/fleet/`** so
  every leader running a pane sweep reads it.

### PX8 #1646 is ONE defect wearing four shard failures

All four panics carry the identical **production** refusal, and all four are the
**baseline arm** of a mutation control — "the unmutated bracket compiles, so the
rows below are not vacuous", and three siblings of that shape:

```
alternative 7 is planned as Fixed(ResourceInvalidOffset) but the emitter built
Fixed(ResourceAllocationFailed), so the path names a different node than the one
being constructed
```

`constructors.rs:6712`, `constructors.rs:6768`, `control.rs:16612`,
`control.rs:16535`. **The count measures how many of Runtime's controls share
one driver program, not the spread of the defect.**

**Attribution is settled — do not re-litigate it.** `main` at `9f4a44d6` was
CI-green (success, 18:15:42Z); the failing run started 18:20Z. **Introduced by
the candidate, not inherited.**

**Two readings are live and they call for opposite edits:** a real
planner/emitter skew from widening the closed sum in `ken-host/src/effect_v1.rs`
(+86/-5), or a stale fixture expectation that legitimately must change because a
variant was inserted. **The edit that fixes the second is the edit that papers
over the first**, so Foundation must state which before editing. **These four
must not be skipped** — the accepted-base skip allowance covers an incidental
failure on an already-accepted base, never the assertion your own candidate
broke.

### The two lanes are contention-free TODAY, on a MEASURED basis

**I measured Foundation's actual candidate diff, not the paths its frame
pinned.** Inferring the second from the first is the error I made yesterday and
it is retired. Foundation's real `ken-runtime` surfaces:

| path | churn |
|---|---|
| `cranelift_backend/lowering/core.rs` | +36/-11 |
| `cranelift_backend/lowering/core/tests/effects.rs` | +223/-5 |
| `cranelift_backend/lowering/mod.rs` | +52/-19 |
| `cranelift_backend/planning/static_transition/semantic_ir.rs` | +4/-1 |
| `native_process_entrypoint.rs` | +3/0 |

Runtime's `D2` surfaces are **`planning/static_transition.rs`** and
**`lowering/units.rs`** — in neither set. But `semantic_ir.rs` **is** Foundation's
and sits one path away under the same module tree.

> **This claim has a shelf life and it is not symmetric.** I can measure
> Foundation's current diff; I cannot measure Runtime's future one. It holds for
> `D2` **as scoped** and dies the moment that scope reaches `core.rs`,
> `mod.rs`, `semantic_ir.rs`, or that `effects.rs` tree.

### #6h is RULED and SIZED — do not reopen either

Option **3**: the planner over-issues; the activated witness is deferred-inline.
Options 1 and 2 refuted. **`M` to `S`.** The **one** overturn condition: if the
reachability rebuild needs the planner's **traversal contract** changed rather
than an edge excluded from it, that is a different node — **hard stop and
route**. Evidence item 5 (*census changes only by ruled-edge removal*) is the
early instrument; a traversal problem shows there as a second changed row.

### Standing, and easy to get wrong

- **Frame existence is NOT node-id-named.** Fourteen frames are not. Check
  `grep -rl <node-id> docs/program/wp/`, never `test -f wp/<node-id>.md`. That
  false test produced three wrong `ready`→`draft` flips (reverted, PR #1645).
- **Genuinely frameless, all off the critical path:** `SPEC-MISSION-GROUNDING`
  (spec, L), `F1-37` (runtime, deps `RT-PARITY`), `MODELS-TIER` (steward, S,
  process work — deprioritized), `RT-CENSUS-CAVEAT-GUARD` (runtime, S,
  dependency-free).
- **`KERNEL-NESTED-IND` is dependency-clear with a 553-line frame.** Kernel is
  idle for want of a **lane**, not a frame. **Do not open a third lane without
  asking the operator** — one additional lane was authorized, and it is
  Foundation's.
- **NEVER publish** held evidence `65639a13`
  (`runtime-implementer/sar-lane-pair-evidence`) or `aa78c973`.
- **Codex seats do not wake on convo mentions — measured four times.** But
  **read the pane before pasting**: both leaders woke on today's mentions, and
  pasting into a `Working` seat is what strands it. Dim composer text is a
  placeholder, not a typed instruction.
- **Pending operator decision, carry it, do not decide it:** the
  causal-obligation formalization question.

## SUPERSEDED 2026-08-08 ~10:5xZ — kept for the `D3` reconciliation detail only

**The block below described Runtime as ACTIVE and `D3` as unblocked. Both are
now false** — see the LIVE block above. Its `D3` frame-reconciliation and
FALSE-FLOOR content is still accurate and is why it survives this rewrite.

**`main = 10a96d22`.** Zero open PRs. Worktree clean, nothing unpublished.

**Runtime is ACTIVE, not held.** `RT-RECURSOR-TRANSPORT` was released and the
ring has taken `D0`, `D1` and `D2` through to approval. The earlier "recut but
not released" hold is **discharged** — do not re-read it as live.

**`RT-RECURSOR-TRANSPORT` state, exact:**

| item | value |
|---|---|
| approved `D2` checkpoint | `8efdfdb3` (QA + Architect, exact-object) |
| branch base | `f4212c2c`, no rebase owed |
| frame on `main` | blob **`f3ea354c`** (PR #1606) |
| `D1` result | **asymmetric** — position B `LexicalCallArgumentRecursor` closed for free **on its exact witness only**; `D2` was position A alone. **The class-wide reading is WITHDRAWN** — see the LIVE block |
| hard stop 2 | **cleared for position A** |
| hard stop 1 | neither triggered nor cleared |
| size | `M`, re-affirmed |
| `D3` | authorized, **no commit yet** |

**Merged this session:** #1582-#1599 (see below), then **#1600-#1603**
(`RT-RECURSOR-TRANSPORT` release, four stale frame inputs, the `D2` technique
withdrawal), **#1604** (`RT-FNUNIT-RESULT-TOKEN` frame: five decode producers
corrected to eight), **#1605** (148 decorative glyphs out of the campaign
artifacts), **#1606** (the `D3` frame reconciliation below).

**Campaign state.** Three of five `RecursiveDescentResidual` classes retired.
`MatchScrutineeRecursor` and `LexicalCallArgumentRecursor` survive in
`lowering/core.rs`; `D3` retires both and is the last migration before
`RT-DESCENT-RETIRE`.

**Seam 3 was recut mid-flight from populate to DELETE** (Architect
`evt_1v9m7t4m9dmj7`, sustaining hard stop 7). The four `BoundaryUse*` axes were
an unowned schema fragment; zero occurrences now remain in `crates/`. The same
ruling **superseded the Architect's own `evt_40ra70t92mjd2`**:
`RT-DECL-CLOSURE-PORT` `D7` never owed a global boundary-use record, and is no
longer a `depends_on` of the ledger seam.

### OPEN, MINE: M8's doc-only discriminator contradicts the Adversary's scope

**Surfaced 2026-08-07 by `evt_5r0hgy45v1r8x`** — the Adversary hunted the
`89916fc1` merge off its own ground-truth read and opened with *"no merge
notification was sent to me for this one."* It was right that none was sent.

**Both of my rules fired and they disagree.** `§10⁻a`'s scope table puts
**`library/` inside** the Adversary's surface. `merge-procedure.md` M8 says
doc-only merges do not concern it and makes **`--doc-only` the discriminator**.
A `library/`-only merge is published `--doc-only`, so it is in scope by one rule
and skipped by the other.

**Cost this time: zero** — the hunt found no defect. **Do not fix this now.**
It is process work, it blocks no product WP, and servicing an Adversary report
immediately is the exact §10⁻ loop. It needs one operator-facing sentence at a
real seam: is the discriminator the *flag* or the *path*? My reading is the
path — `--doc-only` is a CI-cost flag and was never meant to carry scope — but
that is a guess about intent and the operator owns it.

### RT-WORKER-FIXTURE-DECODE: framing falsified two of its own node's claims

Both were read out of the object store at `89916fc1` while writing the frame.
**The node text still contains the originals; the frame §1c/§1d governs.**

1. **"The worker fixture cannot run" is FALSE as a general statement.**
   `run_worker_fixture` (`constructors.rs:5772`) has **exactly two callers**,
   and the other one — `nested_worker_depends_on_both_levels` (`:5895`) — is
   un-ignored and **passing** at both refs the two-ended census measured. Same
   helper, same compile step, same `.run(None)`, same decode path. ⇒ The
   discriminator is the **expression**, not the helper, and that live sibling
   is a working differential already in the tree. **The node title carried the
   false claim into the tracker's releasable-frontier list** — corrected there
   too.
2. **`token` is the native RETURN VALUE (`compiled.rs:132`), not an error
   code.** Eight sites across five decoder kinds raise the one
   `NativeResultDecode` variant, so `token: 9` names no arm. Naming it is `D1`
   and it is the whole diagnosis.

**My hypothesis is recorded IN the frame as a hypothesis, not a pin** — the
`Boundary` unrecognized-tag arm at `compiled.rs:204`. I did not run it. If a
resume tempts you to treat it as settled, it is not.

### The Adversary's F1 is the one open technical question from the merge

`evt_2yxmdfhvt4fm0`, **both findings verified in source by me before folding**,
then folded into the nodes that own them (`RT-WORKER-FIXTURE-DECODE` was `draft`
then and is `ready` now). **The channel is report-only
(COORDINATION §10⁻a) — I did not reply and must not.**

**F1, folded into [[RT-WORKER-FIXTURE-DECODE]].** `RT-SRCBODY-BIND-ORDER`
reversed the Parameter run and left the Capture run in descriptor order
(`lowering/units.rs:4060-4067`), on a predicate `source_body_binding_order`
(`:3689-3699`) that returns `true` for `CallableDeclaration` **and
`ClosureBody`** — and `ClosureBody` is the unit kind that carries captures. The
covering comment at `:4057-4059` appeals to descriptor order, **which is the
exact ground that same commit refuted for the sibling run.**

**Whether captures SHOULD be reversed is NOT established** — it turns on the
elaborator's de Bruijn assignment across a closure environment, which nobody
has read. **Both answers are live. Do not repair it as a bug**; if the
measurement says the capture run is wrong, that is lowering semantics and it
goes to the Architect.

It folded into `RT-WORKER-FIXTURE-DECODE` rather than a new node because
`two_same_shape_workers_are_distinguished` **is** the direct discriminator, and
restoring that fixture is already that node's deliverable. **The axis is
unmeasured precisely because the fixture is dark.**

**F2, folded into [[CI-IGNORED-SWEEP]].** The declared population of 46 counted
what this program **authored**; a sweep selects on the attribute, and the
anchored count is **50** (`ken-cli` 34, `ken-verify` 10, `ken-runtime` 3,
`ken-interp` 3). The four extra are **ignored by policy, not base debt** — one
for ~142s of cost, three for capability not yet in scope for L1 — and would
answer "still belongs" forever. Node now carries a second cut on
reason-for-ignoring, plus the caution that it must not be enforced by parsing
prose reason strings. Also recorded: the one-off no-over-annotation check
covered **44 of 50**.

### THE ENUMERATION WAS CLOSED OVER THE WRONG POPULATION — my error

**"The complete `--no-fail-fast` surface is 40" ranged over `ken-cli` and
`ken-verify`. That is 2 of 8 workspace members.** The workspace is
`ken-kernel`, `ken-elaborator`, `ken-interp`, `ken-cli`, `ken-foundation`,
**`ken-runtime`**, `ken-host`, `ken-verify`, and CI runs
`cargo nextest run --workspace`.

⇒ **Six packages were never enumerated — including `ken-runtime`, the crate the
`D1` repair MODIFIES.** An enumeration that excludes the crate under repair
cannot bound that repair's blast radius. **I accepted the number without asking
which packages it ranged over.**

**What failed** — both unannotated `ken-runtime` lib unit tests in
`crates/ken-runtime/src/cranelift_backend/lowering/core/tests/constructors.rs`:

| test | line | why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| `two_same_shape_workers_are_distinguished` | `:5772` | its own doc comment says swapping a body **or its capture order** changes the linked result, and calls it `AC-5`'s target-redirect red |
| `c2_ac4_runtime_host_result_selects_a_separately_generated_nested_payload` | `:2531` | nested payload selection |

**RESOLVED — the `D1`-regression hypothesis is FALSIFIED, and two was the whole
population, not a floor.** Kept because the *shape* of the error is worth
recognising: I accepted "the complete surface is 40" as authoritative sizing
without asking which packages it ranged over.

### THE CENSUS IS CLOSED OVER ALL EIGHT MEMBERS. Both rows are BASE DEBT.

`evt_ksrhrv82t5ae`, `--no-fail-fast`, one `-p` per command, never `--workspace`
(`COORDINATION §12` unchanged). Absolute counts, passed/failed/ignored:

| package | base `21fd46dc` | candidate `fb99d0fc` |
|---|---|---|
| `ken-kernel` | 215 / 0 / 0 | 215 / 0 / 0 |
| `ken-elaborator` | 1106 / 0 / 0 | 1106 / 0 / 0 |
| `ken-interp` | 178 / 0 / 3 | 178 / 0 / 3 |
| `ken-foundation` | 19 / 0 / 0 | 19 / 0 / 0 |
| `ken-host` | 55 / 0 / 0 | 55 / 0 / 0 |
| `ken-runtime --lib` | 778 / 2 / 1 | 783 / 2 / 1 |

**Both rows fail at BOTH ends with identical signatures.** Base debt, annotated
under the fork, **not** a regression. The `+5` at the candidate is `D3`'s tests
plus the sentinel, not a behaviour change.

**NEITHER IS AN ASSERTION FAILURE — I verified this in the source, not from the
report.** `two_same_shape_workers_are_distinguished` panics on its **first
statement**, in `run_worker_fixture` at `.expect("the worker fixture runs")`, so
all three `assert_ne!` comparisons are **dead code at both refs**.
`c2_ac4_...` panics at `.expect("the C2 carrier edge emits")` — the carrier
refuses to emit. **A `D1` capture-order regression presents as two
configurations comparing EQUAL, an `assert_ne!` firing.** It cannot present as a
fixture that will not execute, and not at a base predating the change.

**The consequence, and it must not be lost in the annotation:** `AC-5`'s
target-redirect red is asserted by a test that cannot reach its assertions.
Annotating switches off nothing that was working, and **un-ignoring it later is
NOT the repair** — restoring the fixture is. [[RT-WORKER-FIXTURE-DECODE]] owns
that; [[RT-CARRIER-PRODUCER-OCCURRENCE]] owns the other.

### THE COLD-WORKTREE ARTIFACT — why no repair credit is claimed

**The ring's first base run reported 738 passed / 42 failed. Re-run WARM, same
ref, same command: 778 / 2 / 1.** The extra 40 were
`native_execution_differential` and `object_linker_packaging` rows needing built
artifacts on disk. **The 42 is a build-state artifact, not a property of
`21fd46dc`** — so any reading that this candidate "fixes 39 rows" is false, and
the **"fixes six base failures" clause is removed from the publish
description.** The implementer caught it because base-full disagreed with
base-lib, and flagged it rather than quietly using the warm number. **A
single-ended run could not have produced that disagreement.**

**The mechanism below is still TRUE and still worth knowing — it just was not
the cause here.** Filed as fleet memory
`a-p-scoped-run-and-cis-workspace-run-compile-different-feature-sets`.

**The bare-name ambiguity DOES NOT EXIST for these two rows.** Each name occurs
**exactly once** in all of `crates/` (`constructors.rs:5772` and `:2531`; every
other hit is under `docs/`). `mod constructors;` is declared once
(`core/tests/mod.rs:59`), `mod tests;` once (`core.rs:12`), there is **no
`#[path]` anywhere in ken-runtime**, and the crate declares **no `[[test]]`,
`[[bin]]` or `[[bench]]` target**. ⇒ One symbol, one binary. **My "disambiguate
by binary" instruction could not have produced a finding, and the premise was my
paraphrase of the implementer's interim, not their report.**

**The actual axis is FEATURE UNIFICATION.** `ci.yml:120` runs
`cargo nextest run --workspace --locked --partition count:N/4`; the ring runs
`-p ken-runtime --lib`. ken-runtime has one non-default feature,
`px8-ds-test-support`, and **`ken-cli`'s `[dev-dependencies]` enables it**. The
workspace is `resolver = "2"`, so one `--workspace` test invocation compiles
ken-runtime once under the **union** its dependents demand. ⇒ **feature ON in
CI, OFF under `-p`.**

**Most gated sites are `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "px8-ds-test-support"))]`,
true in ANY lib-test build — they do NOT discriminate.** The only feature-only
sites are `cranelift_backend.rs:76` and `lowering/mod.rs:12381`. **Do not settle
this by reading them.** The probe:

```sh
scripts/ken-cargo test -p ken-runtime --lib --features px8-ds-test-support --no-fail-fast
```

at **both** ends. Rows flip ⇒ that is the reconciliation. Rows do not flip ⇒ the
hypothesis is dead and the axis is elsewhere; **a dead hypothesis measured beats
a live one assumed.** I did **not** run it — the build lock is the ring's and
contending for it would stall the critical path.

**The general form, and it binds every local measurement:** a `-p <pkg>` run
activates that package's **default** features only; CI's `--workspace` run
activates the **union every member demands, dev-dependencies included.** So the
operator's `-p`-only rule (§12) that keeps the box alive also makes a local
differential **non-equivalent to CI** for any package a sibling enables a
non-default feature on. Cheap check: grep the workspace `Cargo.toml`s for
`features = [` on path deps and carry the matching `--features` on **both** ends.

### RETRACTED — there was NO mention gap and NO stall. Both were MY instruments.

**This block previously reported a three-occurrence mention gap on
`runtime-leader` and a nine-minute implementer stall. Neither exists.**
Retracted to the ring at `evt_4yh3568e6f488`.

**Error 1 — I read a field that does not exist.** Convo events carry mentions
at **`metadata.mentions`**, not at a top-level `mentions` key. My probe read
the top-level key, so it returned `None` for **every event in the space,
including my own posts whose mentions demonstrably arrived.** Measured
correctly, all three of the leader's handoffs were right:
`evt_72f386mgvth4t` → `['agt_37reqvb6ce400']`, `evt_3mj0a2bv40266` →
`['agt_37reqftfe6g00']`, `evt_cjx7b0kgywca` → `['agt_37reqg3nync00']`.

**Error 2 — I truncated the pane probe.** `tmux capture-pane -S -4` showed an
empty composer and no `Working` line, and I called it idle. **The window was
too small to contain the spinner directly above it.** The implementer had been
running continuously for 12+ minutes.

**Both are the same failure: a confident explanation built on an unverified
instrument, which launders a measurement error into a finding.** The tell I
walked past twice: **my own messages showed the identical `None`**, and I did
not ask why. ⇒ **When an instrument reports a defect, first check what it says
about a case whose answer you already know.**

**Cost:** a false correction posted to a teammate and one redundant
re-dispatch. **Do not re-derive the mention gap from an older briefing copy.**

### PUBLISH PRE-CLEARED at `fb99d0fc` — both axes, measured 2026-08-07 ~12:3xZ

| axis | result |
|---|---|
| **base/intersection** | merge-base `e6b4a13b`; `comm -12` of the candidate's changed files against `main`'s is **EMPTY** ⇒ **immaterial, do NOT rebase** |
| **attributability** | `main` is **GREEN** at `533f7c06` ⇒ any red on the candidate is the candidate's |

**`git diff --stat origin/main fb99d0fc` shows 89 files / -22863 and that is
NOT a staleness signal.** A squash applies **merge-base → branch**, never
**main → branch**, so files `main` gained since `e6b4a13b` that the candidate
does not touch are **not** reverted. That stat **fires identically on safe and
unsafe candidates**; the intersection is the only test that discriminates, and
it is empty. (COORDINATION §14(5) correction.)

### DEFECT to raise with runtime-leader AFTER this lands, not now

**Both review requests carried `mentions: None`** — `evt_72f386mgvth4t` (QA)
and `evt_3mj0a2bv40266` (Architect) name the reviewer **in prose only**. That
is the classic silent stall (§2). It did not bite: QA answered and the
Architect pane read `Working`, i.e. **a redundant wake path masked it**. The
next handoff may not be so lucky. One line to the leader at the seam; **do not
interrupt a live review over it.**
> 2. **When it lands**, run M6-M9 (see "Owed the moment the merge lands").

### THE 40-ROW SET CANNOT CLEAR CI ON ITS OWN. Adversary F1/F3, confirmed.

**Do not re-derive this and do not re-open it.** Adversary `evt_4mwy8tmfmm7tw`;
every claim re-measured by me against the tree, not taken on report.

All three binaries that merged node `CI-SKIPPED-NATIVE-TESTS` exists to run are
gutted by the annotation:

| binary | at base `21fd46dc` | annotated |
|---|---|---|
| `px8f_write_partition.rs` | 1 live | **0 live** |
| `px8f_buffer_native.rs` | 1 live | **0 live** |
| `rt_parity_native.rs` | 7 live | **1 live** |

**The two zero-selection jobs HARD-FAIL.** CI installs `cargo-nextest@latest`
= **0.9.140**, whose `--no-tests` default is `auto`, *"defaulting to fail"*.
**Measured directly on a dependency-free scratch crate, with a positive
control:** a binary whose only `#[test]` is `#[ignore]`d exits **4**
(`error: no tests to run`); a binary with one live test exits **0**. The
aggregator (`ci.yml:296-304`) tests only `result == success`, so it fails with
them.

**My "CI should go green in one pass" instruction to the ring was FALSE** and
is corrected at `evt_7wyhwwcnec4yq`.

**The third binary fails the OTHER way and is the more dangerous one.**
`rt_parity_native` keeps one test, so it reports **green** — but the six ignored
rows are exactly the six calling `assert_narrowed_alike`, and the survivor
(`:786`) calls `elaborates()`, a source-scope check. `ci.yml:227` states in its
own voice the condition the job was built to end: *"a green CI carried no
information about whether native and interp agreed."* **True again, and nothing
reports it.**

**Operator ruling 2026-08-07: fold a minimal `ci.yml` companion** — `D15`,
released at `evt_xy3s7s2qf2pq`. `--no-tests=pass` on the two `px8f` jobs **only**
(the flag is fail-open; it is defensible only where the emptiness is known,
owned and named), plus an **in-place correction** of the false `ci.yml:227`
claim. `AC-2` is the load-bearing one: un-ignore one `px8f` row, observe the job
go RED, restore — proving the flag suppresses only empty-selection and not a
real failure.

**Publisher CAN push `.github/workflows/`** — tested, not cited: `ken-ci[bot]`
authored **seven** workflow commits on `main`, latest `a1e29284` 2026-07-27.

### `D15` RESPIN — a SECOND copy of the false claim, at `ci.yml:103`

**The ring found it and asked before spending the review cycle.** My `AC-3`
named `ci.yml:227`, so it was **structurally unable** to catch a second copy
160 lines earlier — the one a reader meets first.

**`AC-3` restated as a property, and this is the durable form:** *no sentence
anywhere in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` asserts in the present tense that
`rt_parity_native` currently carries the interp-vs-native differential;
discharge by grep over the whole file, not by reading the block you edited.*

**Bounded deliberately — do NOT sweep further.** `:92-94`
(`(14m41s, 7 tests) RESTORED`, with a cited measurement source) and the
measurement sentences after `:103` (`7 tests / 266.7s / 470.6s`, the ~250s
outlier, the nested-brackets structural fact) are **records and still true**.
**Instructions get corrected; records stay records.** Over-correcting them is
the opposite error and was ruled out explicitly.

### No over-annotation. The suppressed population was swept once, by hand.

At `7d204438`, on request: `ken-cli` `-- --ignored` = **0 passed / 34 failed**;
`ken-verify` = **0 passed / 10 failed**. **All 44 suppressed rows still fail.**

**Nothing in the repo does this automatically** — `--ignored`,
`--run-ignored`, `include-ignored` grep **empty** across `.github/`, `scripts/`,
`docs/program/`. Every skip is write-only, so a landed repair ships with its own
regression cover off. Filed as **[[CI-IGNORED-SWEEP]]** (`draft`, verify, S) on
the operator's ruling; **not** folded into this candidate.

### Both operator decisions — RULED 2026-08-07, do not re-ask

| question | ruling |
|---|---|
| Nine `ken-verify` `scenario.rs` lib unit tests — in the skip set? | **IN. The set closes at 40, not 31.** Same discipline as the other 31: exact signature, owning node, `fails at base 21fd46dc`. |
| Runtime held, kernel idle with a shovel-ready frame — open a second ring? | **HOLD SINGLE-THREADED.** Do not release `KERNEL-NESTED-IND` or any other node in parallel. |

**PR #1265 was CLOSED at 11:25:19Z** — that item is resolved and needs no
further recommendation.

**The GitHub outage is over and CI works. `main` is `533f7c06`.**

### The candidate is exonerated and `ken-cli` is GREEN

**Candidate: `wp/RT-SRCBODY-BIND-ORDER` at `8696e8c5`. HELD — not routed for
review.** `wp/RT-DECL-CLOSURE-PORT-typed-units` frozen at `21fd46dc`.

**`D12` complete `--no-fail-fast` enumeration** (a closed enumeration, because
fail-fast is per **binary**, not per test): **40 candidate failures, every one
also fails at base `21fd46dc`. ZERO REGRESSIONS.** The candidate additionally
**FIXES SIX** base failures.

**31 authorized rows annotated at `8696e8c5`** — annotation-only, 290+/21-,
nine files, each row carrying its **exact signature**, **owning node**, and
**"fails at base `21fd46dc`"**. Result:
`ken-cargo test -p ken-cli --no-fail-fast` = **120 passed / 0 failed / 34
ignored**. **`px7o` is UN-ignored and passing 3/0.**

### PR BACKLOG CLEARED — 9 open to 3. Do not redo this.

**`main` is `616a0b49`** — PR **#1530** landed 45 commits of Steward corpus
(doc-only; blob-identity verified 20/20). `steward/work` reset to it.

**Closed as stale or superseded, each verified individually, none merged:**

| PR | evidence |
|---|---|
| #1455, #1449 | all commits patch-present on `main` (`git cherry` 0 missing) |
| #1519, #1502, #1421 | differ only on `CURRENT-BRIEFING.md` / `RT-CONTSRC-PRODUCER-LOCAL.md`, both updated on `main` 2026-08-07 |
| #1322 | its 173-line `wp/DOC-W4-LANGUAGE.md` is on `main` **byte-identically** (`87a87052` both sides); every other file has a **newer** `main` version |

**NO consolidated docs branch is needed — that plan is retired.** The four docs
PRs had **no surviving content**; merging any of them would have **reverted**
newer work.

**The instrument that mattered:** blob-difference alone is NOT evidence of novel
content — `main` moving past a PR produces the same signal. Use `git cherry`
(patch-equivalence) plus **which side was touched later**.

**Still open: #1529 (candidate), #1528 (closes as superseded when #1529
lands). #1265 was CLOSED at 2026-08-07T11:25:19Z** — it carried `fb8ec38`,
`430798bf`, `548682c3`, `42ccd8ec`, all explicitly banned from import. **Two
open PRs, both accounted for.**

### The nine `scenario.rs` rows are IN — ruled, dispatched, in flight

The ruling went to runtime-leader as `evt_gjaaqcn0sftc` in `thr_69qrsxjk8wrcd`:
annotate all 40, then **one** review cycle — QA then Architect on the exact
final SHA. A new SHA voids `dec_wyn3kvzhs9at`; read Decisions from the
**object**.

**An unmatched row gets its own node, never a nearest fit.** The ring was told
to stop and ask rather than assign a row to the nearest shape.

### THE NUMBER IS 31 — my off-by-one, twice

I said 39, then 30. **`D12`'s 40 are CANDIDATE failures and `px7o` is NOT among
them — it PASSES.** Removing its wrong annotation removed no row from the
failing set. **40 = 30 `ken-cli` + 10 `ken-verify`**; only **9** of `ken-verify`
are the held `scenario.rs` tests, and `px8f_write_partition` is an authorized
integration row already annotated. **40 − 9 = 31**, plus the four `px4b` = **35
`#[ignore]` total.** The ring caught this and escalated the arithmetic while
following the unambiguous substantive instruction — the right precedence.

### `RT-ENTRY-TRAP-PX7O` IS CLOSED — false premise, mine

CI reports the bare name `nested_err_payload_reaches_both_real_executors`,
defined in **two** binaries. I attributed it to `px7o`; the red one is **`px7n`**
(owned by [[RT-FRAME-MARKER-ONCE]]). **`D10` measured `px7o` at the BASE, where
it does fail, and I carried that forward as if it described the tip.** I also
told the operator the repair "cleared `px4b` but not `px7o`, so it may be
incomplete" — **it cleared both.** Do not re-file the node; do not re-skip
`px7o`. **A bare test name shared by two binaries names neither.**

### Owners, all filed

`BytesPointerLength` → [[RT-CARRIER-BYTESPAN-OBSERVE]]; **`ResourceScalar` →
[[RT-CARRIED-RESOURCE-SCALAR]]** (same refusal shape, **different need** — never
call these byte-span); frame marker → [[RT-FRAME-MARKER-ONCE]]; closure lane →
[[RT-CLOSURE-BOUNDARY-LANE]]; `ComputationalMatch` →
[[RT-COMPMATCH-TREE-SCRUTINEE]]; `ProcessExitStatus` →
[[RT-PROCESS-EXIT-STATUS]]. **An unmatched row gets its OWN node, never a
nearest fit.**

### CI 14 vs local 40 — EXPLAINED 2026-08-07. It was never a second population.

**`.github/workflows/ci.yml:117` runs `cargo nextest run --workspace --locked`
with no `--no-fail-fast`, and there is no `.config/nextest.toml`.** nextest
therefore **cancels the run on first failure**; only the tests already in
flight finish and report.

⇒ **CI's 14 is a TRUNCATED VIEW of the same set the ring enumerated at 40**,
not a disagreeing measurement. This is the identical per-binary peeling caught
at `D10`, one layer up — and it is why sizing an annotation off CI's list can
never converge while sizing off the local `--no-fail-fast` run can.

**Two consequences, both given to the ring.** The closed local enumeration is
the authoritative sizing input. And after all 40 are annotated CI should go
green in **one** pass — **a 41st row would be new information, not another
peel; report it, do not absorb it, do not re-baseline.**

**The ring was right to refuse to size on the discrepancy.** The refusal is
what kept the number honest until the mechanism was found.

### Why the set kept growing, recorded because I missed it once

**`cargo test` and CI are both fail-fast PER BINARY.** One failure and the
binary's remaining tests never run and never report, so **annotating a row
un-hides the next row in the same binary.** The implementer caught this during
`D10` and reported it; **I then scoped `D11` off CI's truncated list and called
it complete.** `D12`'s whole-package `--no-fail-fast` run is the closed
enumeration that ended the peeling.

### ACTIONS IS RECOVERED. The outage block is retired — do not re-diagnose it.

Incident `qcvjkzcs7j74` is over. **Measured 2026-08-07: runs complete normally
and `main` is GREEN at `533f7c06`** (run at 04:47:35Z, conclusion `success`).
Greenness on `main` is what makes a red on a candidate *attributable* rather
than inherited — re-establish it before publishing any cut.

### State of the publish

| item | value |
|---|---|
| local branch `wp/RT-SRCBODY-BIND-ORDER` | **`8696e8c5`** — the `D13` annotation tip, local only, **never pushed** |
| PR **#1529** head | **`aa032cc2`** — the PRE-annotation SHA |
| #1529 CI | **8 failed / 4 passed** — expected at `aa032cc2`, and **not a finding about the ring's work** |
| PR **#1528** | open; closes as superseded when #1529 lands |
| `main` | `533f7c06`, green |

**Do not read #1529's reds as a candidate defect.** The PR head is two
commits behind the annotated tip. The reds are the unannotated base-debt rows,
which is exactly what the 40-row annotation exists to close.

**The publisher force-pushes the head branch, so publishing moves #1529's head
to whatever `wp/RT-SRCBODY-BIND-ORDER` points at.** That is the intended path
here — but assert the branch is at the **reviewed** SHA immediately before the
run, never at whatever the ring last committed.

### THE PUBLISH REF IS FROZEN AT `21fd46dc`. A live trap was disarmed here.

**The ring committed `c4112237` (RT-ENTRY-TRAP-254 `D6`) onto
`wp/RT-DECL-CLOSURE-PORT-typed-units` — which is the HEAD OF APPROVED PR
#1528.** Local moved to `c4112237` while origin stayed at `21fd46dc`.

**The publisher force-pushes `refs/heads/$head_branch` by design, and
`resolve_branch` derives `head_sha` from the BRANCH, not from `--target`.** So
the queued re-run would have pushed `c4112237`, moved the PR head off the
approved SHA, and voided `dec_4w8wn4ymn32cm`.

**Disarmed 2026-08-06:** `D6` preserved at **`wp/RT-ENTRY-TRAP-254-d6`**
(`c4112237`, nothing lost); `wp/RT-DECL-CLOSURE-PORT-typed-units` reset to
`21fd46dc`, matching origin. Ring told to work on the `-d6` branch.

⇒ **BEFORE ANY PUBLISHER RE-RUN, assert the branch is still at the approved
SHA:**

```sh
git rev-parse wp/RT-DECL-CLOSURE-PORT-typed-units   # MUST be 21fd46dc...
```

**`--target <sha>` does NOT protect you.** The publisher resolves the SHA to a
branch and then re-reads that branch's tip.

### RT-ENTRY-TRAP-254 is CLOSED (superseded). The repair is RT-SRCBODY-BIND-ORDER.

**Architect mechanism ruling `evt_7yfs6qxp9hm5b`.** The `D0`-`D9` chain found a
**general multi-parameter source-body binding permutation**; the skipped
`ProcessInput` row is **one discriminator** for it.

**THE DEFECT.** `lowering/units.rs:3701-3790` does **one slot-order walk doing
two jobs**: it records `defining_abi_operands` in ABI descriptor order
(**correct**) and pushes the same operands into `env` in that order
(**wrong**). A declaration body reads **de Bruijn-NEAREST-FIRST**, and
`core.rs:14705-14714` **already states** reverse-then-append. So
`main(input, caps)` gives `env = [input, caps]` while the body names `input` as
`Var(1)` ⇒ `Var(1)` reads `ProgramCaps`. **A bug fix restoring a stated
contract, not a mechanism change.**

**REPAIR:** keep the ABI run and `defining_abi_operands` unchanged; build the
semantic env as `reverse(Parameter run) ++ Capture run in D3 order`.

**`D9`'s ATTRIBUTION WAS REFUTED and the refutation is load-bearing.** It blamed
the common transfer coordinate. `call_declared_unit_target` **already pairs
positionally**, `carry_call_input` cannot select a sibling or change position,
and **a carried word bypasses `transfer_into_carrier` entirely** — so a caller
occurrence there cannot change which word occupies slot 0. ⇒ **Per-argument
transfer coordinates are BANNED: a design change that would leave the defect
intact.** Also banned: reversing the process root's ABI roles, rewriting
continuation specializations, touching `carry_source_call_inputs`,
`carry_call_input`, `call_declared_unit_target`, or `mod.rs:5958-5978`.

**BLAST RADIUS — AGGREGATE-NESS IS NOT CAUSAL.** Not one row, and **not "every
aggregate through `call_declared_unit_target`" — that framing was the Steward's
and is wrong.** The class is **every activated non-root functionized source-body
unit with at least two parameters whose body distinguishes parameter
positions**; it surfaces for ints, bools, capabilities, borrowed handles or
constructors. The 97-`Constructor` census does **not** bound it. **Unary units,
unused parameters and equal values MASK it.** Operator told; **it does not alter
the publish ruling by itself** but is materially larger in logical scope.

**`D2` is not optional:** generated contexts claim **byte-for-byte equivalence**
with the raw unit while installing parameter-then-capture order
(`units.rs:2523-2547`). Fixing the unit alone makes that committed claim
**false** — worse than the original defect, because the claim is what a reader
relies on.

**Four controls, and control 1 is the important one:** a two-parameter
declaration with distinct **NONAGGREGATE** values reading both positions
(proves the fix is not aggregate-shaped); the `ProcessInput`/`ProgramCaps`
discriminator; a root-adapter control proving its ABI-role order was **not**
reversed; raw-worker vs generated-context equivalence on a body that
**distinguishes** its parameters (a unary body proves nothing — unary units are
invariant under reversal). **Expect CI reds and attribute each individually;
never re-baseline.**

**`D6` landed** (stale carried-scrutinee reachability comment) at `c4112237` on
`wp/RT-ENTRY-TRAP-254-d6` — follow-up PR when Actions returns.

### RT-SRCBODY-BIND-ORDER in flight — candidate `5d388e37`, QA HELD

- **`5d388e37`** meets `D1`, `D2`, `D4`, all four controls red-before-green.
- **`D3` control 4 and `AC-3` were AMENDED by the Steward** (`evt_gpekyt7jzb67`).
  The required population does not exist — no body is present at both hosts,
  retargeted raw workers are template-only, **every generated-context worker is
  unary**. The ring reported the weakness instead of widening the fixture.
  **`AC-3` as originally written was UNDISCHARGEABLE and that was a frame defect
  of mine.**
- **The ruling, one fact:** `reverse([p]) ++ captures` is identical to the
  parameter-then-capture order already installed, so **`D2` is INERT at unary
  arity.** ⇒ the obligation becomes an **ACTIVATION GATE** on the first
  multi-parameter generated-context worker, shipped as a **TRANSITION
  SENTINEL** that asserts the measured population and reddens by itself.
  **Non-vacuity required:** observed RED against a hand-added two-parameter
  worker, then restored. **`AC-3` must NOT be recorded as "equivalence
  verified"** — equivalence is unfalsifiable at unary arity.
- **NOT authorized:** changing the checked IH call-site arity to manufacture the
  fixture. Population expansion into a checked mechanism, and the constraint
  demanding it was **this frame's own prose**.
- **ARCHITECT is reviewing `D3c` unrequested** (`evt_28gv50xst6sqf`): tracing
  `RootIsImmediate` from its stored coordinate into the **post-`D1` semantic
  environment**. **This is the right question and I did not think to ask it** —
  `D1` reorders the semantic env, and `D3c`'s per-consumer availability claims
  are keyed to that env, so a claim could now name the wrong value. **QA is
  correctly held pending it. Do not release QA or alter `D3c` until it lands.**

### Compaction verification: a LOW ctx is proof, a HIGH ctx is NOT disproof

**Measured 2026-08-06 on runtime-implementer.** `handoff-gate-compact.sh`
returned, the pane still read `ctx 27%`, and a **full-stream** grep for
`Compacting|Context compacted` returned **0**. I resent `/compact` to that one
pane and ctx went **27% -> 7%** — while the marker grep *still* returned **0**.

⇒ **The marker text is transient and its absence proves nothing** (the progress
bar clears). **The ctx number showing a DROP is conclusive; the ctx number
showing HIGH is inconclusive**, because it can be a stale render.

**So verify in this order:** ctx dropped ⇒ done. Otherwise resend to that one
pane and re-check ctx. Do not conclude "did not compact" from an absent marker,
and do not conclude "did compact" from the script returning.

### GATE MISS, MINE: I released a new node without the before-work compaction

**`COORDINATION §15` / `steward/compaction.md`: always compact before new work,
no exceptions, no threshold, ctx unread.** I released `RT-SRCBODY-BIND-ORDER`
after roughly fifteen consecutive diagnostic releases to the same ring **and
never ran the handoff gate once.** The **implementer asked for the seam** —
the backstop caught what the gate should have.

⇒ **The gate is the fix, the ctx scan is only the backstop.** When the scan (or
a seat's own request) is what catches it, **the gate already failed upstream.**
Run `scripts/handoff-gate-compact.sh <every member>` at each new-node release.

**Mechanism note for next time:** the script does `git reset --hard
origin/main` on each worktree. It was safe here **only because** all three
runtime worktrees sat on their own `<role>/work` branches at `3015aafd ==
origin/main`, so no protected ref was checked out. **Check that first** — the
frozen publish ref `wp/RT-DECL-CLOSURE-PORT-typed-units` (`21fd46dc`) and
`wp/RT-ENTRY-TRAP-254-d6` (`c4112237`) must never be the checked-out branch when
it runs. **And note the base mismatch:** this node's base is `21fd46dc`, not
`origin/main`, so the reset puts worktrees on the wrong base and the ring must
re-checkout.

### Origin's WP ref was DIVERGENT and the force-update was safe

`origin/wp/RT-DECL-CLOSURE-PORT-typed-units` stood at `03f0510c` — **34 commits
that were neither ancestor nor descendant** of the candidate, left by the failed
`fc758323` publish. **`git cherry 21fd46dc 03f0510c` returned `-` for all 34**,
so every one is patch-equivalent-present in the candidate. The publisher's
`--force-with-lease` lost nothing. **Checked before the push, not after.**

### The five rows that ship marked `#[ignore]`

All in `crates/ken-cli/tests/px4b_native_production.rs`, Linux-only. Each
comment carries the exact observed signature, the owning node, and the
branch-introduced provenance (absent at merge base `e6b4a13b` and `main`
`3015aafd`).

| test | owner |
|---|---|
| `fs_write_and_read_resume_through_the_native_capability` | `RT-CARRIER-BYTESPAN-OBSERVE` |
| `fs_scope_denial_reaches_ken_as_the_named_error` | `RT-CARRIER-BYTESPAN-OBSERVE` |
| `canonical_fs_identity_exactly_matches_across_real_producers_and_drift_fails` | `RT-CARRIER-BYTESPAN-OBSERVE` |
| `linked_console_broken_pipe_reaches_ken_instead_of_signal_termination` | `RT-CARRIER-BYTESPAN-OBSERVE` |
| `public_source_observes_raw_argv_environment_cwd_bytes_in_field_order` | `RT-ENTRY-TRAP-254` |

Suite at `21fd46dc`: **14 passed / 0 failed / 5 ignored, no sixth row.**

**A skipped row measures nothing.** Greenness here is achieved by not asking the
question. That is the whole reason both successor frames make un-skipping a
deliverable rather than a courtesy.

### M1 CAUGHT A REAL GATE MISS — record the shape, it will recur

**Both reviewers approved the exact SHA in PROSE and no Decision object bound
it.** `dec_wyn3kvzhs9at` was `resolved` — against the **superseded**
`aa032cc2`. Publishing on the strength of two convincing posts is exactly the
Sec1ct breach, where *"(Architect + Spec)"* read as approval while the
Architect had never voted.

⇒ **Read the Decision store from the OBJECT at merge time, every time.** A
resolved Decision on a superseded SHA is not authorization; it is the most
persuasive possible way to be wrong. Routed back at `evt_6fp23qzn7cf34`; the
leader opened `dec_6zp34ra9hjb58` and it cost one round trip.

**Also: I did NOT append the tracker-sync commit** that `merge-procedure.md`
step 3 asks for on ring candidates. It would have changed the SHA and voided an
approval the Architect scoped to `fb99d0fc` **alone**. The tracker rides my own
corpus publish immediately behind — same durability, no voided gate.

### Owed the moment the merge lands, in order

1. **M6** — blob-identity verify every changed path against `origin/main`;
   then `git reset --hard origin/main` on `steward/work`, which is stale the
   instant any publish lands.
2. **M7** — flip `RT-DECL-CLOSURE-PORT` and `RT-CONTSRC-PRODUCER-LOCAL` to
   `merged`, run `scripts/gen-progress.sh`, publish doc-only.
3. **M8** — notify the Adversary. **This merge carries code, so the step is
   required.** Look the id up at post time with `scripts/moot-actor-id.sh
   adversary`.
4. **Librarian** — `crates/ken-runtime/src/cranelift_backend.rs` is a **cited
   source** in `library/SOURCE-ATTESTATIONS`. Routes to the Librarian **after**
   the merge, never into a ring's frame.
5. **M9** — the stay-one-release-ahead check. Already satisfied: both
   successors are `ready` with written frames.

### Both successors are framed. The ring will not idle.

**`RT-CARRIER-BYTESPAN-OBSERVE`** — `ready`, size L, frame at
`docs/program/wp/RT-CARRIER-BYTESPAN-OBSERVE.md`. Base is **`main`**, not the
branch: the publisher squashes, so `21fd46dc` is not an ancestor of `main`
afterwards. Two findings from grounding it, neither known when the rows were
measured:

- **The `BytesPointerLength` seat population is SIX, not the three that fail.**
  `host_effect_seat_contract` binds one `bytes` tuple at six
  `(operation, ordinal)` pairs. `FsWriteFile Argument(2)`, `FsChangeMode
  Argument(0)` and `FsOpen Argument(0)` are unmeasured. Repairing three leaves
  an identical seat refusing identically; flipping six asserts a capability
  nobody measured — and a shared tuple is exactly what makes it a bad
  discriminator. `AC-4` requires a per-seat disposition over all six.
- **The carrier reads a carried byte value one byte at a time and cannot read
  its extent at all.** `BOUNDARY_LOCAL_HELPERS` has `ken_boundary_byte_local` by
  index and a `store_bytes_len` **writer**, and no length reader anywhere.
  `ken_boundary_int_view_local` is the precedent for the missing shape and
  `narrow_carried_int_u64` for its reader. **A per-index reader does not
  establish that a contiguous pointer can be produced** — that is `D1`, and a
  negative answer is a representation boundary that returns to the Architect.

**`RT-ENTRY-TRAP-254`** — `ready`, size **S and DIAGNOSIS ONLY**; the repair is a
separate cut on its return. Two things its frame settled:

- **The exit `1` is not the defect and must not be investigated.** The linked
  shim ends `if (value < 0) return 1;`, so every negative sentinel collapses to
  1 and the exit code cannot distinguish `-1` from `-4`. Only the stderr line
  can. The fact that matters is that the entrypoint returned **`-4`**.
- **`254` IS the correct expectation — that open obligation is DISCHARGED.** The
  test sets `K` to byte `0xfe` under `env_clear()` and asserts `254`, a second
  arm at `253`, and `assert_ne!` between them. Those are legitimate non-negative
  exit codes: the program observes a raw process byte and returns it, and
  `return (int)value` passes non-negative values through. The program is meant
  to compute a byte and traps instead. **Do not repair the row by changing the
  expectation** — the frame bans it as the cheapest available false fix.

### Standing bans that survive this window

- **Do not fold `RT-ENTRY-TRAP-254` into byte-span** because "bytes" appears in
  its test name. That is the vocabulary inference the Architect refuted
  (`evt_7v61ed5pn9q3t`). Shared root cause is **unmeasured**.
- **Do not justify `RT-CARRIER-BYTESPAN-OBSERVE` from the historical
  `c7410b79` `BoundaryCarrier` signature.** Same refutation.
- **Read a Decision from the object, never from a message.** Measured again this
  window: the Architect posted "resolving on cast" and the object still read
  `proposed` for ~30s.

## CORRECTIONS — two claims the old file made that were FALSE

Both were **time-varying state wearing a permanent-looking hat** — the exact
failure the heartbeat prompt bans. Recorded so the *shape* is recognisable, not
just the instances.

### 1. "ARMED COUNTERS — the SOLE count of record" was stale AND retired

It read `RT-NATIVE-FNSPLIT: hard-stop 10 · next research pull #11` and `Architect
production blocks: 6 · next check #9`. **Both numbers were behind**, and the chain
they counted **is retired** — the operator stopped the FNSPLIT effort on
2026-07-26 and `SPEC-STORE-SPLIT` replaces it.

**A counter calling itself "the SOLE count of record" is the worst thing to
leave stale**: it invites a reader to trust it *instead of* measuring. ⇒ **There
are no armed counters now.** When the re-cut program exists, its node owns its
counts.

### 2. "TRANSPORT — convo MCP mostly DEAD" is FALSE

The old block claimed only `set_interval`/`subscribe` survived and routed all
reads through scratchpad HTTP scripts. **Measured across this entire session:
`orientation`, `list_decisions`, `post_response`, `list_participants` all work
over MCP.** Tracked as task `#110` because **the heartbeat prompt still repeats
the claim.**

**What IS true — the part worth keeping:**

- **NEVER call `mcp__convo__get_transcript`.** Its `limit` does not bound the
  response and it takes the stdio connection down with it. Operator prohibition;
  fleet law in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Mentions arrive TRUNCATED** — a doorbell, not a message. Fetch full text via
  the HTTP read path, with **your own** credential.
- **`list_decisions` can exceed the result cap** and spill to a file — grep the
  file rather than retrying the call.
- `claude mcp list` reporting `convo: ✔ Connected` **is not evidence** — it
  health-checks a fresh process.

## Preserved refs — QUERY LOCALLY. `origin` carries `main` ONLY.

> ### THIS SECTION WAS FALSE AS WRITTEN. Both halves.
>
> It said *"Origin holds 26"* and gave `git ls-remote origin
> 'refs/heads/preserved/*'` as the query. **Operator ruling, 2026-07-26:** *"clean
> up all of the non-main branches at origin."* ⇒ **All 63 non-`main` origin
> branches are deleted.** That `ls-remote` now returns **nothing**, and a reader
> running it would conclude the work was lost.

**Measured 2026-07-27 — the query is local, and the population is larger, not
smaller:**

```sh
git for-each-ref 'refs/heads/preserved/*'    # 78 refs
git ls-remote --heads origin                 # refs/heads/main — and nothing else
```

**A branch on one local ref is the NORMAL state of preserved work, not an
exposure.** Do not raise an unpushed ref as a finding.

**AND THE "EXISTS NOWHERE ELSE" CLAIM WAS WRONG ON EVERY ITEM IT NAMED.** Each
was checked at `origin/main = a1e29284`:

| the old claim | measured |
|---|---|
| `preserved/b2e-rejected-source-oracle` = `159f4109` | **present locally at that exact SHA** |
| `wp/RT-FNSPLIT-B2E-boundary-value-elimination` = `e1b540e2` | **present locally at that exact SHA** — delete neither |
| `preserved/rt-fnsplit-b2f-hardstop-{9,10,11}-evidence` | **no local ref of that name exists** — and it does not need to. Hard-stops #9/#10/#11 are all on `main`, across **12** files (`RT-FNSPLIT-B2{E,F,O,R,V}.md`, `RT-NATIVE-FNSPLIT.md`, `RT-VALUE-TOTALITY.md`, the B2O report + predictions, two WP frames, `diary/2026/Jul/25.md`). `bce75fec` is literally *"make hard-stop #11's evidence durable"*. |
| `preserved/architect-state-*` | **wrong prefix** — the refs are `preserved/architect-work-*` (5 locally). A ref name you cannot resolve is not a backup. |

**The transferable part: a "this exists nowhere else" note is a claim about a
population you did not enumerate, and it decays in both directions at once** — the
copy you were protecting had already landed in the repo, while the ref name you
recorded it under never existed. ⇒ **Re-derive from `for-each-ref` and `git grep`
on `main`; never from a hand-kept list of what is precious.**

## Operator rulings — 2026-07-21 ~12:45Z. SETTLED, do not reopen.

Kept inline deliberately: this is law, and a settled ruling is a **fixed input,
never a question to re-ask.**

- **No "ratification."** The Linux ABI II charter is a **planning document, not a
  commitment.** Nothing outside the project depends on our timelines. Do not
  re-raise status-correction as a decision.
- **Where anticipated and done diverge, fill the gap first** — hence
  `docs/program/10-linux-abi-completion.md`.
- **L2-1: no cross-compilation. CROSS-PLATFORM IS INDEFINITELY DEFERRED**
  (restated 2026-07-21 after I re-raised it). Manifest v2 is family-scoped and
  generated, **not** cross-target.
  **This ruling ALREADY ANSWERS any non-linux finding** — do not route one back
  as a scoping question. Record such findings as *observations against a deferred
  lane* and stop.
- **L2-0: all desirable, nothing deferred.** All nine `RepresentedUnavailable`
  operations get promoted.
- **Timing, timelines, and budget are the OPERATOR'S domain.** Do not reason
  about schedule or cost.
- ★ **My lane is token efficiency in terms of delivered work.** That is the axis
  to optimize and the one to report on.

**Standing test policy (operator, 2026-07-26):** *"Test oracles that assert facts
about source code, catalog, or documentation lines are an invitation for failure
and delay. Tests should focus on behavior."* ⇒ Executable form: **"does an edit
that changes nothing about how any program behaves make this test fail?"**

**Standing gate policy (operator, 2026-07-26):** the library currency ledger is
generated **at version release points**, **not enforced per merge.**

**`origin` CARRIES `main` ONLY (operator, 2026-07-26; restated 2026-07-28).**
A branch living on one local ref is **normal** and is never a finding. No
durability sweeps, no pushes of WP or seat branches, no ring reporting an
unpushed ref. The publisher's own candidate-branch push stays — that is how it
opens a PR.

**THE `integrator` SEAT IS RETIRED (operator, 2026-07-26).** *"remove any
references to the integrator. that seat was retired weeks ago."* ⇒ Every operative
reference is gone as of PR #1052 (`a1e29284`, 50 files) — PR template, CODEOWNERS,
`ci.yml`, four devcontainer files (including a **functional** `ctx-nudge.sh` case
arm), `COORDINATION.md`, `04-git-and-integration.md`, 40 WP frames, the roster
(29→28), git refs, worktrees. **The chronicles keep the word deliberately** —
`docs/program/diary/`, `agent/memory/MIGRATION-LOG.md`,
`docs/program/ds-campaign-judgment-log.md` (17 files, 501 occurrences): there it is
a true account of what the process **was**. **Instructions get corrected; records
stay records.** One residual is not mine to clear — the convo **participant**
still exists; see the LIVE block's operator-owed list.

**Canonical width: 96 (operator, 2026-07-26).** *"re 88 v 96. 96 is what it should
be. It was an incomplete revision, apparently."* ⇒ `spec/30-surface/31-lexical.md`
and `CANONICAL_WIDTH` are correct; `conformance/` is the stale side.
`SPEC-31-WIDTH-ERRATUM` reconciles it. Do not re-argue the value.

## Where durable law lives — do not restate it here

**The old file's real defect was restating durable rules inside a diary.** A
rule copied into a briefing drifts from its source and then contradicts it. ⇒
**Point, never copy.**

| what | where |
|---|---|
| federation law, §2c handoff gate, §14 merge gate | `agent/COORDINATION.md` |
| my playbook, publish discipline | `agent/playbooks/federation/steward.md` |
| hard-won operational lessons | `agent/memory/` (`fleet` + `enclave` + `roles/steward/`) |
| model tiers | `agent/MODELS.md` |
| reasoning charter | `docs/PRINCIPLES.md` |
| no local `--workspace` builds — CI only | `agent/COORDINATION.md §12` |
| build status against the DAG | `docs/program/IMPLEMENTATION-PROGRESS.md` |
| spec status | `spec/SPEC-PROGRESS.md` |

## Standing traps — only the POSITIONAL ones

Each is here because it fires **at a specific command**. That is the whole test
for belonging in this file rather than in `agent/memory/`.

- **Verify landed content by BLOB IDENTITY, never ancestry.** The publisher
  squashes, so an approved SHA is correctly *never* an ancestor of `main`.
- **Verify every object you NAME exists at the base you NAME** —
  `git cat-file -e <base>:<path>`, and quote the blob (§2c step 5b).
- **`git diff --stat` always exits 0.** Use `--quiet` for an emptiness test.
- **The publisher's exit code is the LAUNCHER's** — confirm it exited *and* that
  `main` moved.
- **Never `git fetch` while the publisher is inside its merge→verify window** —
  `refs/remotes/origin/main` is shared across ~70 worktrees.
- **Never `pkill -f`** (matches your own shell) · **never `git stash`**
  (`refs/stash` is shared) · **never `git checkout <ref> -- .`** (reverts
  uncommitted edits worktree-wide).
- **A probe truncated before its filter is not a measurement.** Search the full
  stream; truncate the RESULT.
- **Never dump `.moot/actors.json`** to learn its shape — use
  `scripts/moot-actor-id.sh <role>`; the schema-discovery step is what leaks a
  key. Look up a participant id **at post time**, never from memory.
- **`steward/work` is stale immediately after every publish** — reset onto the
  squashed `main` before writing anything new.
- **A `--doc-only` merge can redden `main` and is structurally unable to notice.**
  After one, **enumerate consumers of the touched paths** — attestation ledger,
  measured-token censuses, source-text oracles. This is how `95bc855c` broke three
  things and reported none.
