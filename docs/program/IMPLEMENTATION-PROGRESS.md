# Implementation progress — the build backbone

**Owned by the Steward** (`agent/playbooks/federation/steward.md §2a`). This
file tracks execution **against the implementation DAG**
(`05-implementation-dag.md`), the build's analog of `spec/SPEC-PROGRESS.md`.
It **survives compaction**: on a cold start or after a compact, read this
first, then continue from the frontier (below). Update it **every synthesis
pass and on every WP state change**. The plan lives in `05`; this file
tracks *progress against it*. Run until complete, blocked, or instructed
(§2b).

**This file holds CURRENT STATE ONLY, and it is GENERATED** — edit
`docs/program/issues/*.md` and re-run `scripts/gen-progress.sh`; hand edits
here are overwritten. The full chronicle — every prior "live state"
snapshot, the detailed evidence trail for every merged WP, and the
day-by-day session logs back to project start — lives in
[`diary/`](diary/INDEX.md). If you need *why* a past call was made, or the
mechanism detail behind a closed WP, start there;
[`diary/CURRENT-BRIEFING.md`](diary/CURRENT-BRIEFING.md) carries the live
operator briefing and the Steward's resume state.

**Status legend:** `draft` (not framed / deps unmet) · `ready` (deps met,
unassigned) · `active` (a team is building) · `in-review` (PR open / QA / CI)
· `merged` (landed + retro in) · `closed` (resolved without landing, e.g. a
superseded or withdrawn item). Gates: see `05-implementation-dag.md`.

**★ GENERATED FILE — do not hand-edit.** This file is regenerated from the
frontmatter of every `docs/program/issues/*.md` work-item file by
`scripts/gen-progress.sh`. To change tracked status, edit the relevant
`docs/program/issues/<ID>.md` file and re-run the generator. CI checks that
the committed file matches the generator's output.

| `CI-L1-EXECUTING-COVER` | Three executing, green l1_acceptance rows certify conformance cases they cannot check -- sec62 never issues the conversion query its soundness row turns on, sec61 names a row id that does not exist, and ac5_no_implicit_cross_type_coercion is satisfied by an elaboration limitation rather than by the coercion refusal it claims | merged | verify | M | none | — |
| `CI-ROW-CLAIM-COMMENT-FORM` | verify-row-claims extracts only from /// doc comments, so a row claim written with // is invisible to it -- two false soundness certificates survive on main in exactly that form | merged | verify | S | none | — |
| `CI-ROW-CLAIM-NAMESPACE` | verify-row-claims hardcodes surface/ in both its claim and heading patterns, so eight of the nine conformance namespaces are structurally invisible to it -- a claim it cannot see is indistinguishable from a claim that does not exist | merged | verify | S | none | — |

| `CI-TRACKER-GATE` | Wire the issue-tracker schema + regeneration gate into CI | closed | operator | S | none | 804 |
| `CONF-EVAL-COMPUTED-BOOL-ELIM` | The conformance matrix does not state that a closed computed Bool consumed by the Bool eliminator selects the same method as the corresponding constructor -- the two runtime representations reach the eliminator by independent index derivations and nothing ties them together | merged | spec-enclave | S | none | — |
| `CONF-FMT8-LEVELTOK` | FMT8's fixture is unproducible: the row demands a 'genuine level-token fixture' but the lexer has no Level/Label token kind and never will under endpoint (b) | draft | spec-enclave | S | none | — |

| `RT-CONTSPEC-LEDGER` | ContinuationSpecialization seam 3 — retire the boundary-use schema: the four BoundaryUse axes are compile-time constants that no lowering, ABI, selection, lifetime, or emission consumer reads, so they are deleted from the continuation-specialization contract | merged | runtime | S | none | — |

| `RT-CONTSRC-CALLABLE-CONTRACT` | Closed callable-contract arm for continuation sources — a recursive IH is a compiler-only static worker with no value carrier, and the enclosing slot authority is unconditionally a value contract, so its environment sits outside the domain RT-CONTSRC-PRODUCER-LOCAL owns | ready | runtime | M | none | — |
| `RT-CONTSRC-PRODUCER-LOCAL` | Producer-local continuation source coordinate — a mid-body value is a third availability class with no ABI seat, so continuation specialization cannot name its environment | merged | runtime | L | none | — |
| `RT-DECL-CLOSURE-PORT` | Transparent-declaration-closure emission port — a retained TransparentDeclarationClosure residual forces the whole object onto the monolithic RecursiveDescent root, which exceeds Cranelift's per-function ceiling | merged | runtime | L | none | — |

| `RT-FNSPLIT-C2-SYNTH-ID` | closed synthesized-constructor-role identity capability, with the DynamicConstructor producer that consumes it — the identity source compiler-synthesized effect payloads have no occurrence to ask for | merged | runtime | M | none | 1186 |
| `RT-FNSPLIT-C3-ACTIVATION` | the opaque activation owner — one Rust representation authority in ken-runtime that constructs, publishes and tears down per-invocation boundary storage, with the deployment-supplied capacity profile and the one-argument public adapter seam | merged | runtime | L | none | 1181 |

| `V4-RESIDUAL` | The Kripke countermodel is an inert shell: it is never related to `φ` at all — no interpretation of the formula, no recursive forcing evaluator — and V3's prose `description` is stuffed into `FormRef`, a slot meant for a structural subformula reference | merged | verify | L | G2-G3 | 1117 |

## Releasable frontier

Items whose status is `ready` and whose every `depends_on` entry is
itself `merged` or `closed` (i.e. nothing left blocking a kickoff):

- `LANG-NESTED-MATCH-LIFT-ALIGNMENT` — the generated-All aligned check path is lost when the lifted match is nested under an outer contribution, so a residual-Bag fold cannot type-check
- `RT-CALL-EDGE-EXECUTABILITY-AXIS` — executable_call_edges probes a body-axis set with an entry-axis key, so a template-only callee whose axes differ survives the filter and fails later as a forward-declaration error
- `RT-CANDIDATE-LEDGER-RESIDUALS` — Two named population questions on the merged candidate/disposition ledger were never reached, and the node that could have covered them is closed
- `RT-CARRIER-PRODUCER-OCCURRENCE` — a source aggregate reaches the carrier with no planner-issued producer occurrence, so the C2 edge refuses to emit and the nested-payload selection row never exercises its property
- `RT-CENSUS-CAVEAT-GUARD` — The identifier-census caveat's staleness guard is an existence check standing in for a count check, so it cannot detect the drift it was written to catch
- `RT-CONTSRC-CALLABLE-CONTRACT` — Closed callable-contract arm for continuation sources — a recursive IH is a compiler-only static worker with no value carrier, and the enclosing slot authority is unconditionally a value contract, so its environment sits outside the domain RT-CONTSRC-PRODUCER-LOCAL owns
- `RT-EFFECT-DIFF` — One reusable rich differential boundary over EffectObservation — interpreter vs native, first-divergence reporting, so backend-local tests can observe what only the CLI suites currently can
- `RT-FNSPLIT-B2O-CHECK` — the B2O checking layer advertises more than it enforces — structural closure for the item enumerator and reachability for the validator arms
- `RT-FNUNIT-RESULT-TOKEN` — Broad starter shapes fail the result-token table on the FunctionizedUnits lane — pre-existing, unmasked by retiring SeedClosureCall
- `RT-LEXICAL-RECURSOR-CONSUMERS` — Repair the LexicalCallArgumentRecursor consumer population on the functionized lane, activated by B-only exclusion before the retirement removes the seam
- `RT-WORKER-FIXTURE-DECODE` — AC-5's target-redirect detector is dark — its expression dies at the run step with Backend NativeResultDecode token 9, before any of its three comparisons, while the fixture helper's other caller passes
- `SPEC-ERRATUM-39-2-3-CITATION` — Erratum: 34-data-match.md:625 still cites `39 §2.3` for higher-order pattern abstraction, a coordinate the structural-result merge reassigned to Structural-result association
- `SPEC-SELECTOR-SORT-SPLIT` — split the recursive-result selector by motive sort -- `recursive result for x` when Type-classified, `induction hypothesis for x` when Omega-classified -- and remove `structural result of x`
