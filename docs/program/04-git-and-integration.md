# Git Workflow & Integration Authority

How the Ken teams share one workspace, branch, review, merge, and stay
coordinated. The defining choice: **build/spec agents never touch GitHub.** They
work in a single shared clone via per-agent worktrees and do **local git only**.
A single **publisher** identity, driven by the checked-in scripted publisher
path under Steward/operator control, is the federation's only GitHub-network
actor (push, CI, merge, fetch).

Two systems, one split of responsibility:

- **GitHub** — system of record for **code and CI**: the canonical `main`,
  branches the publisher pushes, the build/conformance/clean-room checks, and
  protected merges.
- **mootup** — system of record for **coordination and review**: per-team
  spaces, the **merge/review Decisions**, and **notifications** of fresh `main`.

They are bridged by artifact references: a mootup Event can carry a branch or
commit reference, so a merge and its review Decision live in both places without
either being authoritative over the other's domain.

Governing rules (non-negotiable):

1. **`main` is always green.** CI (build + conformance) runs on GitHub's CPU and
   gates the merge **before** it lands. Nothing merges red.
2. **Build/spec agents do local git only — no credentials.** The publisher is
   the sole GitHub identity: it pushes branches, reads CI, merges, and fetches
   `main`.
3. **Teams never merge.** Teams produce commits on a local branch; the
   publisher path merges.
4. **Clean-room is enforced at the merge gate.** No AGPLv3 or other
   copyleft-derived code enters `main`; the **Spec enclave** grounds the spec
   in permissive references and first principles (see `01-strategy.md`).
5. **One source of truth per concern.** Code/CI → GitHub. Coordination + the
   review/merge Decision → mootup. Don't duplicate authority.

This doc is realized by work package **F1** (workspace, worktrees, the publisher
identity, branch protection) and depends on the GitHub repo existing — which it
does (`swe-toolkit/ken`) — and the shared dev workspace being provisioned.

---

## 1. The shared workspace (how N agents avoid clobbering each other)

The whole fleet runs in **one devcontainer** with **one clone**. Per-team
devcontainers would buy nothing — same disk, RAM, and CPU, and the same in-clone
deconfliction problem. Edits are segregated by **git worktrees**, not by
separate checkouts.

- **One worktree per active agent**, under `.worktrees/<agent>`. An agent edits
  only inside its own worktree; the single `.git` is shared, so every branch and
  every fetched ref is visible to all worktrees at once.
- **No worktree ever sits on `main`.** An idle agent rests on its current
  `wp/<ID>` branch or a `<role>/idle` home branch. The **publisher's** worktree
  stays on `main` permanently and is the only one that does. Create a WP branch
  with `git branch wp/<ID>-<slug> main`, never `git checkout -b` from `main`
  (which would move a worktree onto `main`).
- **Rebase onto `origin/main` at startup.** The publisher does all network I/O;
  when it fetches, the shared `origin/main` ref updates for *every* worktree. So
  each agent picks up merges with a local `git rebase origin/main` — **no
  network and no credentials required** (public-repo reads aside, agents never
  need even that — the ref is already local).
- **Commit before you hand off.** Never hand off uncommitted work: the next
  agent and the publisher can only see committed state. Handing off a dirty
  worktree is a protocol violation.
- **Worktree/`main` mismatch is a named stall class.** A change is **not live**
  for other agents until it is **merged to `main` AND they have rebased**. "It
  works in my worktree" is the classic false-resolved bug — verify against
  `origin/main`, not your own tree.
- **Build/test only via `scripts/ken-cargo`, scoped to your crate** — never raw
  `cargo` or `--workspace` (COORDINATION §12). The full-workspace build runs in
  CI, on GitHub's CPU, not on the laptop.

---

## 2. Branch & WP model

- **One work package = one branch** `wp/<WP-ID>-<slug>` — e.g.
  `wp/K1-core-type-theory`, `wp/V3-prover-backend`. Exploratory spikes:
  `spike/<team>/<topic>`. Work packages — definition, lifecycle, and ownership
  (the Steward) — are in `03-program-of-work.md`.
- **The ring is sequential (COORDINATION §0), so one WP branch is handed between
  worktrees.** The implementer commits to `wp/<ID>` in its worktree, then
  returns to its home branch (freeing the branch); QA checks `wp/<ID>` out in
  *its* worktree, verifies, commits any small repairs, and returns home. No
  per-role sub-branches are needed because only one agent edits at a time.
- **Small PRs merge faster and keep `main` green.** A large WP (e.g. K1, V3) is
  split into a short series of `wp/<ID>` branches, each merged on its own.
- The WP branch is the unit the **publisher pushes for CI** and the
  **publisher path squash-merges** (one commit per WP).

---

## 3. Credentials & the publisher (the one GitHub identity)

Exactly **one** credentialed GitHub identity exists: the **publisher**. It is
operated through the scripted publisher path below, under Steward/operator
control. It is the federation's whole GitHub *write* surface — pushing
`wp/<ID>` branches to trigger CI, merging, and fetching `main`. No seat holds a
standing credential; any seat may mint a short-lived token to run **read-only**
`gh` (e.g. reading a failed run's Action logs). Who may write vs. read, and how
to mint, are the `gh-access` skill (`agent/playbooks/tools/gh-access.md`).

**All merge requests route to the Steward.** A ready WP branch (deps merged,
gates green, merge Decision resolved) is handed off with a `git_request` to the
**Steward**, who operates the publisher path — verify base/scope → push → CI
gate → merge → relay the merge + retro routing. The Steward is the **sole merge
router**, and the publisher is the fleet's only write credential.

- **Why one identity.** It collapses the per-team-account apparatus to a single
  **write** account and shrinks the standing-credential surface to that one
  account. Build/spec agents stay GitHub-unaware for their normal work — local
  git and mootup — and mint a read-only token only to diagnose a CI failure
  (`gh-access` skill).
- **The CPU offload is preserved — as a pre-merge gate.** The heavy work (full
  `--workspace` build + the conformance suite + the clean-room scan) still runs
  on **GitHub Actions**, on GitHub's CPU. Because the publisher pushes the WP
  branch *before* the merge, CI runs *before* the merge and gates it. The 8-core
  laptop never runs a full-workspace build. Moving to local merges did **not**
  move compute back onto the box — only one identity now drives the push.

### 3.1 Scripted publisher path

The publisher no longer needs a model-driven agent loop for ordinary PR
handling. The preferred mechanical path is:

```sh
scripts/scripted-pr-automerge.sh \
  --target <sha-or-branch> \
  --title "<WP>: <what>" \
  --description-file <desc.md> \
  [--doc-only]
```

Inputs are deliberately minimal:

- `--target` is the exact approved SHA or branch;
- `--title` is the public PR title, with no PR number in it;
- `--description` / `--description-file` is the public what/why PR body;
- `--doc-only` marks a docs-only change.

The script creates or finds the PR and performs the publisher merge gate. For
docs-only changes it runs the squash merge immediately. For non-doc changes it
reads the most recent completed `CI` workflow duration, waits that duration plus
10%, then starts polling the PR checks. Once all checks pass, it runs the squash
merge and returns. Remote head-branch deletion is handled by the repository
setting, not by the script, because `gh pr merge --delete-branch` can fail after
a successful remote merge in the shared-worktree layout. The merge command uses
the publisher's admin merge authority, guarded by the exact PR head SHA, because
the `main` ruleset may otherwise block the branch update even after required
checks pass. If GitHub still blocks the merge command, the script fails with
that fact rather than pretending the publisher identity can approve its own PR.

This preserves the important boundary: GitHub/CI remains the code gate, and
mootup remains the coordination/review record. The script replaces the model
tokens previously spent on mechanical PR polling and approval, not the upstream
review decision.

### 3.2 PR description standard (Steward-owned; restored 2026-07-11)

The Steward authors every PR body via `--description-file`. A PR description is
**not** a one-line what/why — it is the
**self-contained provenance record** for the permanent GitHub history, carrying
what the mootup coordination thread holds so the PR stands on its own once the
thread scrolls away. The discipline, which must not lapse, is a fixed structure
for every non-trivial PR body:

- **`## Summary`** — what changed and why, 1–3 sentences.
- **`## Scope`** — files with per-file `+ins/−del`, additive-vs-rewrite, and the
  trust-surface statement (kernel / spec / prelude / Cargo / TCB touched, or
  explicitly none).
- **`## Provenance (mootup review record)`** — the WP (+ brief path); **each gate
  that approved it, with its event-ID and the exact SHA** (implementer handoff,
  Foundation/team QA, Architect fidelity/soundness, CV/Spec when in-lane); and
  the **Steward honesty-gate result** (ancestry, scope, trust-surface grep,
  WP-token screen).
- **`## Test evidence`** — the suites run with pass counts and the
  trusted-base-delta result.
- **`## Follow-ups / surfaced`** — surfaced gaps, queued follow-up WPs, and any
  non-blocking nit explicitly deferred (so it is not silently lost).

A doc-only PR may compress Test evidence to "docs only — nothing elaborates" but
still carries Summary / Scope / Provenance / Follow-ups. The test: a reader of
`origin/main`'s history can reconstruct the full review chain from the PR body
alone. Keep the mootup git_request terse (it points at the durable record); put
the **fullness in the PR body**, because that is what outlives the thread.

---

## 4. Review & merge — in mootup, gated by CI

Review is a **mootup Decision**, not a GitHub PR approval: the reviewers
(Architect, Spec) hold no GitHub accounts, so they review the **diff from the
shared local branch** and vote in mootup.

- When QA approves a WP, the owning **leader** opens a merge **Decision**
  (`propose_decision`, naming the WP ID + `wp/<ID>` branch) in the integration
  space, mentioning the **Architect** (always) and **Spec** (only if it touches
  `/spec`, `/conformance`, or a designated soundness path), and asks the
  **publisher path** to publish the branch.
- The **Architect** (+ **Spec** on its paths) read the diff locally (`git diff
  origin/main...wp/<ID>`) and vote the Decision — a blocking review names the
  concern and the alternative; an approval is a real judgment.
- The **publisher publishes** `wp/<ID>` → CI runs build+test · conformance ·
  clean-room · path-guard on GitHub.
- **Merge gate — all must hold:** the Decision is approved (Architect always +
  Spec on its paths), CI is green, the clean-room check is green, and no passed
  roadmap gate (G0–G8) regresses. The publisher then **squash-merges on
  GitHub** — branch protection requires the green checks and restricts the merge
  to the publisher — and **fetches**, so `origin/main` updates for all
  worktrees.
- The merge **Decision resolves** on the merge, giving an auditable log aligned
  1:1 with merges (`list_decisions`).

Domain correctness is gated *before* this, by the team's QA step in the ring —
it is not a separate reviewer. **Teams do not merge.**

---

## 5. mootup mapping

- **One space per team** (`ken-kernel`, `ken-verify`, `ken-language`,
  `ken-runtime`, `ken-ergo`, `ken-foundation` — build teams — plus `ken-doc`
  (doc-leader + doc-author + the Librarian as its QA) and `ken-spec`,
  the clean-room enclave). The team leader is the accountable participant;
  members set presence with `update_status`. (Research is not a standing team —
  the Steward dispatches it ad hoc; see
  `agent/playbooks/federation/steward.md`.)
- **One coordination space** where the federation roles — Steward, Architect,
  Librarian — live alongside the teams, so cross-team context flows.
- **All GitHub I/O is the publisher path's**, so every GitHub signal reaches the
  fleet only because the publisher caller mirrors it into mootup mentioning the
  actor whose move it is (build/spec agents never see GitHub; see
  `agent/COORDINATION.md §14`). An optional `ken-ci` webhook→mootup bridge can
  automate the CI-result mirror; until it exists the publisher caller posts it
  by hand. The map:

  | Event | mootup message (type) | space | mentions | posted by |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | WP QA-approved, ready to merge | `decision` (open) + `review_request` | integration | Architect (+Spec on its paths) | leader |
  | Publisher opened PR; CI running | `status_update` | team | — | publisher caller |
  | CI red | `blocked` | team | implementer | publisher caller |
  | CI green + Decision approved | `decision` (merge) | integration | publisher caller | publisher caller |
  | Merged to `main` | `status_update` (ship) | integration | Steward only | publisher caller |

  The branch/commit rides each message as an artifact reference; the *detail*
  (the diff, the CI log) is fetched on demand — by the reviewer locally, or by
  the publisher via its identity. Workers never watch CI: only the publisher
  path sees it, and it surfaces red/green as a mention (`agent/COORDINATION.md
  §14`).
- **The merge Decision is the review record.** Opening it *is* the review
  request; the Architect/Spec votes are the review; the publisher caller
  resolves it on merge or rejection. GitHub PR approval is only the publisher
  gate.
- **Architecture decisions (ADRs) are also mootup Decisions** — proposed in the
  coordination space, resolved by the operator/Steward, then committed to
  `docs/adr/`. The mootup Decision is the discussion+ratification record; the
  committed ADR is the durable artifact.
- **Notification of fresh `main`:** on merge, the publisher caller posts a ship
  Event in `ken-integration` and **mentions the Steward only** (operator,
  2026-07-04), with the merged WP and the commit. Team leaders are **not**
  notified on a raw merge — they have no action to take on it. A team rebases
  onto the
  already-fetched `origin/main` (no network) when it picks up its next WP; the
  **Steward** owns post-merge sequencing and routes any downstream work —
  including a cross-team rebase, if a merge affects an in-flight WP — to the
  relevant team via that next release/kickoff.
- **Cross-team dependencies** (the graph in `02-roadmap.md`/`03`) are
  coordinated via the linked spaces and mentions: when WP-B depends on WP-A
  landing, the B-team leader watches A's merge Decision and is mentioned on its
  resolution.

## 6. The merge lifecycle (end to end)

```
0. (intra-team ring) implementer commits to wp/<WP-ID>-<slug> in its worktree,
   scoped builds via ken-cargo → returns to home branch → QA checks the branch
   out, verifies (small repairs ok) → leader packages. Domain correctness is
   gated here, before the merge.
1. Leader opens the merge Decision in ken-integration (mentioning Architect
   always + Spec on its paths), naming the WP ID + wp/<ID> branch, and asks the
   publisher to publish.
2. Publisher pushes wp/<ID> to GitHub → CI runs: build+test · conformance ·
   clean-room · path-guard (on GitHub's CPU). concurrency:cancel-in-progress
   kills superseded runs on new pushes.
3. Architect (+Spec on its paths) read the diff locally and vote the Decision.
4. CI green AND Decision approved → publisher path squash-merges on GitHub
   (branch protection: required checks + merge restricted to the publisher),
   one commit with the WP ID in the subject, then fetches so origin/main updates
   for all.
5. Publisher caller verifies main green, resolves the merge Decision, posts the
   ship Event in ken-integration mentioning the Steward only, and sweeps the
   merged wp/<ID> branch. Steward digests the log; the operator hears only
   gate-level news.
6. Impacted teams rebase active branches onto the new origin/main (no network).
7. Owning team runs the retro (each working agent posts a `retro`; the leader
   collects + hands "retros in" to the Steward). The WP is not *done* until this
   lands (agent/COORDINATION.md §10).
```

`main` stays green at every step because CI gates the branch **before** the
merge, and branch protection refuses a merge whose required checks aren't green.

---

## 7. Clean-room reminder in the git context

The merge gate is where clean-room compliance is *mechanically* enforced:

- Implementation work must derive from **spec sources** (`/spec`, conformance
  tests), not from any copyleft `file:line`. The merge Decision records this;
  the publisher path checks it.
- The CI **clean-room/provenance check** scans for copied AGPL text and flags
  license headers. (Design in F1; can start as a denylist + manual review.)
- The **Spec enclave** is the only team that may consult copyleft references
  (for behavior and approach only, under the leakage recheck); its branches
  touch `/spec` and `/conformance`, never implementation crates. This is
  visible in the team's branch/review boundaries.

---

## 8. Setup & graduation

Decided: org/repo **`swe-toolkit/ken`** (public OSS); **GitHub Actions** CI;
**squash** merges; **one publisher identity**. The single-publisher mechanics
— the one account/App, branch protection (required checks + merge restricted to
the publisher), and CI wiring — live in **`docs/ops/github-setup.md`**.

- **Deferred graduation — the full GH-PR apparatus.** Per-team GitHub
  identities, CODEOWNERS-driven review routing, and a merge queue (the runbook
  in `docs/ops/runbook-gh-identities.md`) are **not** set up now. They are taken
  up only when **external contributors** arrive or **per-team GitHub review**
  becomes load-bearing — at which point review moves from mootup Decisions onto
  GitHub PRs. Until then the single publisher + mootup review is the whole
  model. The decision is recorded in `../adr/0003-credential-free-publisher.md`.
- **mootup bridge (optional):** a GitHub-webhook → mootup bridge that mirrors
  the §5 CI-result events. Because only the publisher path sees GitHub, the
  bridge merely saves manual mirroring; the workflow does not depend on it.
