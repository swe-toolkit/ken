# RT-LEXICAL-RECURSOR-CONSUMERS — repair the Position B consumer population

Owner: Runtime. Size: **M, provisional** — see Sizing.
Authority: Architect ruling `evt_5w09dcwbf7k70` (2026-08-08), narrowed to rows
1-5 by the partition `evt_3r4j14fv1jtj2` on census `evt_16cmej481q7ns`.

**Read `docs/program/16-recursive-descent-retirement.md` first** — the campaign
context and the five traps that bind every node in this arc.

> # ROWS 1-5 ONLY. ROW 6 IS [[RT-MATCH-RECURSOR-CONSUMERS]]'s.
>
> An earlier revision of this node claimed all six red rows and asserted they
> shared `host_result_closure_match`. **Both claims are withdrawn.** `d8d`
> enumerates exactly `{MatchScrutineeRecursor}` and was never in this
> population.
>
> **Do not fold the two nodes.** Distinct producer, distinct activation hook,
> distinct observed boundary, distinct completion owner. A shared production
> root, if the two `D1` partitions later prove one, is a **subsumption proposal
> routed before coding** — never inferred from shared retirement timing or
> shared syntax.

## 1. Fixed inputs

**Measure every one yourself at your pinned base.** These were measured at exact
`D2` `8efdfdb3fb39fc6e66708635cdf11269758d77ed`; your base is later by
construction. **Anchors to re-find, not values to trust.**

**Eight expressions, five families, as originally measured.** Every activation
denominator is a real
compile through `px8j_capture_source_trace`, and **every unexcluded compile
returns `Ok`** — so each row's red is produced by the lane change, not by a
fixture that was already broken. **None of the nine measured expressions is
A+B**, so no simultaneous exclusion is ever needed.

> ### THE TABLE IS THE NARROWER OF TWO REAL DENOMINATORS — SIZE AGAINST THE WIDER
>
> [[RT-MATCH-RECURSOR-CONSUMERS]]'s `D0` census at `bcf3218b` measured the
> **whole `ken-runtime` lib suite** and puts B at **16 compiles across 10
> tests** — against the eight expressions across five families above.
>
> **Neither figure refutes the other, and that is the point.** They are
> different denominators: the table is the six named fixtures under B-only
> exclusion; the census is every compilation in the lib suite that reaches the
> production predicate. **The wider one is what a sizing decision must see**,
> and it is why this node's `M` is provisional in the same way its sibling's
> was.
>
> ⇒ **`D0` closes the population from the production predicate at your own
> base. Neither number above is closure** — the table is a floor and the census
> is a differently-scoped floor. If `D0` lands materially above 16 compiles,
> **that is a re-size signal: post it and stop**, exactly as the sibling did.
>
> **Two bounds the sibling's census carried, which apply here unchanged:**
>
> 1. **It covers the `ken-runtime` lib suite only.** It is `#[cfg(test)]`, so
>    `rt_parity_native`, `px8f_buffer_native` and `px8f_write_partition` are
>    **not** covered — and those compile real Ken programs.
> 2. **The selector has TWO populations and a compile-keyed census sees one.**
>    Programs that compile through `select_body_emission_authority`, and
>    controls that **call it directly without compiling**. Three artifact rows
>    in the sibling's `D1` reacted to the probe while appearing nowhere in its
>    census. Production reaches the selector only from the compile path, so the
>    compile-keyed closure is the right one **for a repair** — but any claim
>    about *everything that consults the selector* needs both, and `AC-1` must
>    not be read as the wider claim.

## 2. What is owed

**A repair of the `LexicalCallArgumentRecursor` consumer population on the
functionized lane, proven on the pre-retirement tree.**

Not owed, and banned: the lane deletion ([[RT-DESCENT-RETIRE]]); the retirement
itself ([[RT-RECURSOR-TRANSPORT]] `D3`); row 6 or anything in the
`MatchScrutineeRecursor` population ([[RT-MATCH-RECURSOR-CONSUMERS]]).

## 3. Deliverables

### `D0` — close the population from the production predicate

**The population is the production `LexicalCallArgumentRecursor` predicate: a
lexical-closure call with a direct computational-match argument carrying a
recursive position. The eight measured expressions are a floor.**

Sweep every compilation entry that can supply that predicate. Record every
firing fixture and every same-family green control.

**Candidate selectors — helper spelling, snake_case fixture spellings,
`BodyEmissionAuthority::RecursiveDescent` assertions — are not closure.** They
tell you what to open, never what a fixture enumerates. This arc has already
paid twice for treating a selector as a perimeter.

### `D1` — activate and attribute, before any repair

Under **B-only exclusion**, the existing one-variant hook used as designed:

- each of the eight reproduces its **exact first refusal**;
- the ordinary retained run stays **green**;
- at least one same-helper B fixture that already works on `FunctionizedUnits`
  stays green as a **positive control**;
- **exact activation denominators recorded**, so a refusal cannot be credited
  where the path was never reached.

**Trace each red to the first missing or mis-consumed static fact.** Partition
by correlated continuation owner/origin, pending suffix, operand phase/kind,
source-machine/composed consumer seat, and boundary reached.

**The five rendered refusal strings are not five proven causes, and the shared
`ComputationalMatch` text is not proof of the `D2`-A mechanism.**

### `D2` — repair only the proven root boundary or boundaries

Reuse planner-owned continuation specialization / call identity and ordinary
typed-value transport where they already name the edge.

**The lawful fix makes the protocol or fact get consumed or represented at its
owner *before* the guards. It never teaches a downstream guard to accept a
forbidden state.**

### `D3` — discriminating controls

All rows stay **enabled and unchanged in meaning**, green under B-only exclusion
at the pre-retirement base. **A mutation at each repaired root recreates the
attributed refusal while proving the detector was reached.** The simple
Position-B witness, Position A's exact `D2` counts/suppression control, and
unaffected same-family controls all stay green.

## 4. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1 — the population is closed by measurement, not by grep.**
  *Control:* the handback enumerates each fixture in the production-predicate
  population with its complete residual set, and names the candidate selectors
  used. A grep list alone does not discharge this.
- **AC-2 — every repaired root has a committed discriminating control.**
  *Control:* reds under a mutation at that root, greens without it, from the
  committed tree, with evidence the detector was reached.
- **AC-3 — the five load-bearing guards are intact.** None may be weakened:
  1. `RecursiveBackedge` stays protocol-only and never becomes an accepted
     source boundary value;
  2. a closure is never made boundary-transferable;
  3. an actual non-constructor computational scrutinee still refuses;
  4. source-join closeout still rejects an un-emitted/unselected join;
  5. a missing recursive-IH authority still refuses.
  *Control:* a committed negative witness per guard, each with a positive
  control proving its path is reached.
- **AC-4 — no banned mechanism.** No fallback to `RecursiveDescent`, no
  `BoundaryUse`, no `PlannedEffectSeat` widening, no lowering-minted token, no
  invocation-local activation/resume/return-hole state in ABI data.
  *Control:* name the ABI payload at each new crossing and show ordinary typed
  fields; `BoundaryUse` stays at zero production hits.
- **AC-5 — zero new `#[ignore]`.**
  *Control:* `git diff` on the candidate contains no added `#[ignore]`.
- **AC-6 — no retirement and no lane deletion in this candidate.**
  *Control:* both variants, both classifier insertions, both collector
  insertions and the exclusion hook are present and unchanged at the final SHA.
- **AC-7 — the candidate contains NO tracker `status:` change.**
  *Control:* `git diff` over `docs/program/issues/` is empty of `status:` lines.
- **AC-8 — CI green** on the merge. Not a local `--workspace` run
  (`COORDINATION §12`).

## 5. Banned scope

- **No `#[ignore]`**; quarantine was ruled out and not reopened.
- **No reshaping a fixture or absorbing a refusal** to make a row pass.
- **No simultaneous exclusion of both variants, no generalized hook.**
- **No reinterpreting a retained `RecursiveDescent` run as activation.**
- **No touching row 6** or the `MatchScrutineeRecursor` population.
- **No resume or cherry-pick of `10369776252861e8b15e613576256a3682c70066`.**

## 6. Hard stops

**Return the partition before coding** if `D1` finds materially distinct
authorities rather than downstream symptoms of one root, or if any repair needs
a new planner/ABI population.

**And: if this partition and [[RT-MATCH-RECURSOR-CONSUMERS]]'s appear to share
one exact production root, route a subsumption proposal — do not fold.**

## 7. Base

**Post-[[RT-MATCH-RECURSOR-CONSUMERS]] `main`.** Cut
`wp/RT-LEXICAL-RECURSOR-CONSUMERS` from `origin/main` after that node merges.
Keep both residual variants and the per-variant exclusion hook for the whole
node.

## 8. Contention

`lowering/core.rs` and `core/tests/control.rs` — the same two files as
[[RT-MATCH-RECURSOR-CONSUMERS]], [[RT-CARRIED-CONTINUATION-RESUME]],
[[RT-CARRIED-ORDINARY-COMPOSITION]] and [[RT-RECURSOR-TRANSPORT]] `D3`. **All
contend; they are serialized deliberately.**

**This node is last of the carried chain and ahead only of
[[RT-RECURSOR-TRANSPORT]] `D3`.** The chain grew by two nodes on 2026-08-08 as
the refusal walked outward, so if you are reading a Steward artifact that still
calls this node "second of three", that figure predates
[[RT-CARRIED-CONTINUATION-RESUME]] and [[RT-CARRIED-ORDINARY-COMPOSITION]].

## 9. Sizing

**`M`, provisional.** A scoping figure from a symptom count; five refusal
strings are not five causes, and `D0` may widen the population.

Checkpoints, exact SHA posted at each: `D0` population closure · `D1` activation
and causal partition · `D2` repair · `D3` controls. **Post `D0`/`D1` as its own
checkpoint before starting `D2`** — that is the Steward's re-size point.
