origin: Architect re-rule evt_3r4j14fv1jtj2 (2026-08-08) on the nine-expression census evt_16cmej481q7ns, partitioning RT-RECURSOR-TRANSPORT hard stop 4 by measured residual population. Row 6 (d8d) is a D2 completeness defect in Position A, not a lexical-successor row. Campaign docs/program/16-recursive-descent-retirement.md node #6d. Steward-filed (agents cannot create tracked work per COORDINATION §2).

## What it is

**Row 6, `d8d`**, the composed binding-site fixture. It enumerates exactly
`{MatchScrutineeRecursor}` — it was never in the `LexicalCallArgumentRecursor`
population, and B-only exclusion is not merely weak for it but **inapplicable**:
the hook's own `debug_assert` refuses an exclusion of a variant that is not in
the set.

Under **A-only exclusion** at `8efdfdb3` it reaches `FunctionizedUnits` and
refuses:

```
Unsupported(UnsupportedLowering {
  construct: "RecursiveBackedge",
  reason: "protocol machinery is never a source value at a boundary" })
```

## The population is the production predicate; `d8d` is a floor

**`D0` closes the population from the production `MatchScrutineeRecursor`
predicate — not from `d8d`'s spelling.** One fixture is a witness, never a
perimeter, and this node was created precisely because a one-witness result was
read as a class-wide property.

## `D1` — activate and attribute before any repair

**A-only exclusion is the activation seam**, proven at `8efdfdb3`. Use the
existing one-variant hook exactly as designed.

- Reproduce each row's **exact first refusal**.
- The ordinary retained run stays green.
- Record **exact activation denominators**, so a refusal cannot be credited when
  the selector or harness never reached the path.
- **Trace each red to the first missing or mis-consumed static fact**, and
  attribute the owner. A rendered refusal string is a symptom, not a cause.

**Banned:** simultaneous exclusion of both variants, a generalized hook, any
`#[ignore]`, and reinterpreting a retained `RecursiveDescent` run as activation.

## The guard that may not be weakened

**`RecursiveBackedge` remains protocol-only and may never become an accepted
source boundary value.** The lawful repair makes the protocol get **consumed or
represented at its owner before the value boundary**; it does not teach the
downstream guard to accept the forbidden state, and it does not make the marker
boundary-transferable.

Also banned as mechanisms: any fallback to `RecursiveDescent`, `BoundaryUse`,
`PlannedEffectSeat` widening, a lowering-minted token, and invocation-local
activation/resume/return-hole state in ABI data.

## Why it goes FIRST, ahead of [[RT-LEXICAL-RECURSOR-CONSUMERS]]

**It closes the claim the `D2` record correction is in the act of narrowing.**
That correction says the A population is *still open at `d8d`*; this node is
what closes it. Landing B first would leave that open statement standing longer
for no gain.

**Do not fold the two nodes together.** The exact residual producer, activation
hook, observed boundary and completion owner all differ. If the two `D1` causal
partitions later prove one exact shared production root, **route a subsumption
proposal before coding** — Runtime may not infer it from shared retirement
timing or shared syntax. Conversely, **materially distinct authorities are a
hard stop** for either node's provisional size.

## Size

**`M`, provisional**, and the provisional part is real: `d8d` is one measured
expression and `D0` may find the A population materially wider. **Return the
partition before coding** if it does.

## Sequence

1. `10369776252861e8b15e613576256a3682c70066` stays **held evidence only**.
2. **DONE** — the bounded `D2` record correction landed at `89aa1550`.
3. **DONE** — this node's `D0`/`D1` closed the A population at two rows, one
   root; its `D2` repaired `carried_join_arm` at `50808c11`. That repair is
   **correct and lands as an accepted partial**; it is not this node's
   completion, because it advanced the refusal to a sibling authority.
4. **[[RT-CARRIED-CONTINUATION-RESUME]] releases and merges** — inserted here
   2026-08-08. It gates this node's `AC-1`.
5. **This node completes and merges.**
6. [[RT-LEXICAL-RECURSOR-CONSUMERS]] releases and merges.
7. [[RT-RECURSOR-TRANSPORT]] `D3` resumes from the resulting `main`, reapplies
   the retirement and the `AC-2b` dispositions, and proves all six old-green
   rows green **without exclusion**.

Both successor nodes block `D3`. [[RT-DESCENT-RETIRE]] remains downstream.

## The edges, and the one that is deliberately absent

`depends_on: [RT-CARRIED-CONTINUATION-RESUME, RT-CARRIED-ORDINARY-COMPOSITION]`
— **two successors, added 2026-08-08 in that order** as each was measured.

The first was added on the Architect's sibling-authority ruling
`evt_2pt95vbja6447`. This node's `D2` repair at `carried_join_arm` is built and
correct, and it advanced both A rows to a **new** owner,
`lower_computational_match_value_composed`.

The second was added on the Architect's fourth-wall ruling `evt_63ae56tttz9pq`.
[[RT-CARRIED-CONTINUATION-RESUME]]'s `D2` was **also** correct and advanced both
rows **again**, to the `Carried x Ordinary` pre-delegation guard family left
unported by [[RT-PRODUCER-MATCH-PORT]].

⇒ **`AC-1` cannot close here until both successors land.** Each addition
followed a repair that worked, not one that failed — the refusal is walking
outward through a fail-closed chain, and this node's `AC-1` is the thing that
closes when it runs out of walls. **Expect the possibility of a third
successor**; if one appears, it joins this list rather than reopening anything
above it.

**[[RT-RECURSOR-TRANSPORT]] is still not in `depends_on`, and that is
deliberate.** This node's base is post-`D2`-correction `main`, and that
correction is a *partial* merge of that node, not its completion. Naming it
would be a **cycle**, since its `D3` is blocked on this one. The base is stated
here and in the frame; the machine-checked edge is
`blocks: [RT-RECURSOR-TRANSPORT]`.
