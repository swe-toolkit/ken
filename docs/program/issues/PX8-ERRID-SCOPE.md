## Per-row constraints the Architect fixed — ⛔ settled inputs, do not re-derive

1. **`MalformedResource`** — a real `ResourceErrorV1` identity emitted by
   resource resolution **before** positioned backend I/O. Because checked
   `BufferHandle`/resource constructors are sealed, the honest reaching seat
   may be the **production runtime/ABI boundary**, not a forged checked Ken
   value. ⛔ A malformed ABI envelope dying as a terminal decode error **is not
   this row**.
2. **`InvalidBounds`** — must reach the actual read/write consumer, return
   exact `InvalidBounds`, produce **no** progress value, and prove the backend
   was **not invoked** where the fault is pre-I/O. ⛔ An unrelated
   buffer-allocation bounds rejection does not discharge the positioned row.
3. **allocation ≠ `BufferLimit`** — ⛔ blocked on [[PX8-ERRID-ALLOC]].
4. **unsupported/nonblocking posture** — inside **only** as the synchronous
   rejection identity: exact `ResourceHostIO Unsupported`
   (`IoErrorIdentityV1::Unsupported`) from the real synchronous positioned
   backend, preserved as an error. ⛔ **PX8 gains no nonblocking mode and no
   retry/status result.** Retain a **negative** assertion that `WouldBlock` is
   absent from PX8's progress vocabulary; ⛔ a test that manufactures
   `WouldBlock` or adds a nonblocking input belongs to **PX12**.
5. **host-I/O ≠ `Interrupted`** — reach a different **stable named** backend
   identity through the real positioned path (prefer write-side
   `ResourceHostIO BrokenPipe` or another exact named `IOError`), ⛔ not an
   undifferentiated harness failure. If exercised after a successful
   `writeAll` prefix, the exact prefix is preserved and no bytes past it are
   claimed.

## ⛔ What the closure claim may NOT count (Architect, verbatim scope)

> *enum construction, a hand-fed error, a terminal ABI-decode failure, or one
> engine's result as the other engine's oracle.*

⇒ **Each row must bind its real producer to the real interpreter/native
reification route and assert the exact locked-spec identity independently.**

---

⛔ **This was the half of [[PX8-WROTE-ABS]] that could not be sized.** A2a (the
interpreter capped-short `Wrote` absolute oracle) is framed and released;
this is A2b.

## The gap

`conformance/behavioral/buffer-io/seed-buffer-io.md:619-645`. Five PR-C error
identities have **no independent reaching evidence**:

- `MalformedResource`
- `InvalidBounds`
- allocation-failure distinct from `BufferLimit`
- unsupported-nonblocking posture
- host-I/O-failure distinct from `Interrupted`

These are values reified by the positioned/partial IO path, so clause (a)'s
**universal** absolute-evidence claim cannot be made while they are unreached.

## ⛔ SUPERSEDED — the scoping question this section posed is ANSWERED

⚠ **This section formerly said the in-scope set was an open normative call and
that the node must not be framed as an implementation WP.** Both are now false:
the Architect answered on 2026-07-27 (`evt_6tzss92ckj2by`) — **all five inside,
none outside, no operator narrowing needed** — and the per-row constraints are
recorded at the top of this file.

⭐ Kept rather than deleted because the *reason* the question had to precede the
sizing still holds and is worth transferring: a team handed "add reaching
evidence for five error identities" would have silently picked route 1 for all
five, which would have made the scoping call by default instead of answering
it. **The answer happened to be route 1 — but it was not the ring's to make.**

⇒ The residual risk is now different and narrower: route 1 for all five is
correct, so the way to get this wrong is no longer a silent trim but a **weak
witness** — see the "may NOT count" list above.

## Disposition

⭐ **The scoping ruling is DONE** (`evt_6tzss92ckj2by`), so this is now an
ordinary build WP: production-reaching absolute evidence for five exact rows.
Owner moved `spec-enclave` -> `verify` — it is oracle/evidence work of the same
class as `BUDGET-EFF` and [[PX8-WROTE-ABS]].

⛔ **Not releasable until [[PX8-ERRID-ALLOC]] merges** — row 3 has no identity
to assert against until then, and releasing four-of-five invites a silent
partial close of a clause whose whole point is universality.

⚠ **`PX8` does not close until this and [[PX8-WROTE-ABS]] and
[[PX8-F-CAP-41]] all discharge**, and the closure property is re-verified.
