**This issue exists because PX8 had none.** `docs/program/10-linux-abi-completion.md`
makes **15 of its 18 items** unblock on `PX8 --> ABI-R3` and `PX8 --> PX9`, and
**nothing in the repository defined when that happens.** The sub-issues existed;
the parent did not. So "is PX8 done?" was a judgement call with no artifact
behind it — which is the same *restated-instead-of-derived* defect that
**ABI-R3 exists to fix**, applied to the program's own root.

## ⛔ Closure condition — a PROPERTY, not a checklist

Per `10-…:239-241` (*"Frames must state the mechanism, not name one"*), the
gate is the property. The sub-issue list below is the **currently known
sufficient set**, not the definition — if these all merge and the property does
not hold, **PX8 is not done.**

> **PX8 is closed when: every value the positioned/partial IO path reifies into
> checked Ken code is (a) correct against the LOCKED text of
> `spec/30-surface/38-ffi-io.md`, asserted ABSOLUTELY rather than differentially,
> and (b) indexed to the same request/span/buffer as every other value in the
> same reply — on BOTH the interpreter and the native backend.**

Two clauses, both load-bearing, both learned the hard way:

- **(a) absolutely, not differentially.** `RT-PARITY` merged green with six
  differentials over a **shared wrong basis**. A differential is a *relative*
  oracle: it establishes that two implementations agree, never that either is
  right. Where the spec is the authority, the oracle asserts against the
  **normative text**. This is exactly how `BUDGET-EFF`'s defect survived.
- **(b) co-indexed.** `SPAN-SEAL`'s whole subject. `BUDGET-EFF` is the same
  shape arriving through **reification** rather than through a producer: the
  span is correct and the count's `remaining` is indexed to the *raw* request
  while the span is indexed to the *effective* one — two halves of one
  `ReadSome` describing different requests.

## Known sufficient set

| sub-issue | status | note |
|---|---|---|
| `SPAN-SEAL` | ✅ merged | co-indexing for carrier producers |
| `RT-PARITY` | ✅ closed | interp/native parity — **necessary, not sufficient**, see (a) |
| `BUDGET-EFF` | ✅ merged | `remaining` bounded by the effective request |
| `SEAL-2` | ✅ merged | derived carrier-producer enumeration (PR #912 @ 4ac9141e, CI green) |
| `RT-ESCAPE` | ✅ merged | native-lowering completeness (PR #911 @ 238a5c5d, CI green) |
| `RT-SPLIT` | ✅ merged | ruled NOT a PX8 semantic dependency (see below) — does not gate |

> **The known-sufficient set went fully green as of `origin/main = 4ac9141e`
> (2026-07-23) — and PX8 STILL DID NOT CLOSE.** The Architect's grounded
> closure-property verdict (`evt_163mfgjs7fkh8`) derived the live reified-value
> population from the closed Rust sums (`ReadEof`, `ReadSome(BufferSpan,
> TransferCount)`, `Wrote(TransferCount)`, `SemanticErrorV1` — `crates/ken-host/
> src/effect_v1.rs:2089-2101`) rather than from the WP list, and found the
> property **fails on both clauses**. This is exactly the outcome this file was
> created to catch: the named mechanisms all merged, and the property still had
> holes. **Three closure-insufficiency items now gate PX8** (do not close until
> all three discharge AND the property is re-verified):

### ⚠ RT-SPLIT is bundled into PX8 by the docs, and probably should not be

`RT-SPLIT` is a **pure maintainability decomposition** of
`cranelift_backend.rs` (22,081 lines) and its own text says it *"feeds no
G-gate."* `10-…:272-275` lists it among PX8's in-flight set, but on its own
terms it carries **no semantic obligation** in the closure property above.

**Ruling (Steward, 2026-07-22): `RT-SPLIT` does NOT gate PX8.** It is real work
and stays queued for the Runtime ring, but `ABI-R3` and `PX9` **do not wait for
it**. Holding 15 items behind a file-splitting refactor would be a pure
sequencing loss. If someone believes it *is* a semantic dependency, the burden
is to name which clause of the closure property it discharges.

## Why this matters downstream

`ABI-R3` (the derived operation inventory) and `PX9` (cross-domain
`System.Error`) are the two gates. **Nothing else in the completion program
moves until they open**, and between them they transitively gate every item
except `ABI-R1` and `ABI-S3`. `PX9` alone gates six items including the whole
of Track T.

## Notes

- **Do not close this issue on the sub-issue list going green.** Re-check the
  property. The list is evidence, not the definition — that distinction is the
  entire reason this file exists.
- The completion program's coverage record is `10-linux-abi-completion.md` §9.
  Update it when this closes.
