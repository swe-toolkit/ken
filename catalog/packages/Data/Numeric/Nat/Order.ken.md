# `Ord Nat` — a lawful total order on `Nat`, and its operations

`Nat` is inductive and kernel-proved, so its total order can be a real,
zero-`Axiom` `instance Ord Nat` — unlike `Int`, which is an opaque
primitive and can only postulate its laws. This entry exports that
instance plus the small set of `Nat` operations (`min`, `max`, `sub`,
`compare`) that build on it.

## 1. Motivation

Natural numbers have a structural total order: it is reflexive,
antisymmetric, transitive, and total. This entry exposes that order as an
`Ord Nat` instance, so generic code can use the same ordering interface for
`Nat` that it uses for other ordered carriers. It also provides the everyday
operations `min`, `max`, `sub`, and `compare`.

## 2. Order and its laws

`leq_nat` follows the constructors of `Nat`. Its reflexivity, transitivity,
and antisymmetry proofs have the same shape as the corresponding `Ord`
fields. Because `IsTrue b` is defined as `Equal Bool b True`, these proofs
fit those fields by ordinary unfolding; no conversion is needed. Each
recursive law is attached to `leq_nat` and uses its `leq_nat::name` path for
self-reference.

```ken
import Core.Logic.Or (Or, Inl, Inr)

fn leq_nat (m : Nat) (n : Nat) : Bool =
  match m {
    Zero ↦ True;
    Suc m2 ↦
      match n {
        Zero ↦ False;
        Suc n2 ↦ leq_nat m2 n2
      }
  }

proof refl for leq_nat (x : Nat) : Equal Bool (leq_nat x x) True =
  match x {
    Zero ↦ Proved;
    Suc x2 ↦ proof refl for leq_nat x2
  }

proof trans for leq_nat
      (x : Nat)
    : (y : Nat)
      → (z : Nat)
      → Equal Bool (leq_nat x y) True
      → Equal Bool (leq_nat y z) True
      → Equal Bool (leq_nat x z) True =
  match x {
    Zero ↦ λy. λz. λp. λq. Proved;
    Suc x2 ↦
      λy.
        match y {
          Zero ↦ λz. λp. λq. absurd p;
          Suc y2 ↦
            λz.
              match z {
                Zero ↦ λp. λq. absurd q;
                Suc z2 ↦ λp. λq. proof trans for leq_nat x2 y2 z2 p q
              }
        }
  }

proof antisym for leq_nat
      (x : Nat)
    : (y : Nat)
      → Equal Bool (leq_nat x y) True
      → Equal Bool (leq_nat y x) True
      → Equal Nat x y =
  match x {
    Zero ↦
      λy.
        match y {
          Zero ↦ λp. λq. Proved;
          Suc y2 ↦ λp. λq. absurd q
        };
    Suc x2 ↦
      λy.
        match y {
          Zero ↦ λp. λq. absurd p;
          Suc y2 ↦ λp. λq. cong Nat Nat x2 y2 Suc ((proof antisym for leq_nat) x2 y2 p q)
        }
  }
```

**Why `total_leq_nat` is a `fn`, not a `proof`.** `Or : Omega → Omega →
Type`. Its two alternatives are propositions, but the disjoint sum is data:
case-splitting on whether the left or right alternative holds must preserve
which branch was chosen. An `Omega`-valued disjunction would make `Inl` and
`Inr` proof-irrelevantly equal and erase that choice; a proof-relevant,
two-constructor inductive therefore cannot live at `Omega`.

`total_leq_nat` computes whether `leq_nat x y` or `leq_nat y x` holds and
returns the corresponding tag. It is therefore a program and is declared as
a `fn`. In contrast, `leq_nat::refl`, `leq_nat::trans`, and
`leq_nat::antisym` conclude `Equal` or `IsTrue` propositions at `Omega`:
proof-irrelevant facts, so they are declared as `proof`. The vocabulary
follows the `Omega`/`Type` boundary: `theorem` and `proof` establish
irrelevant propositions; `const` and `fn` compute data.

```ken
fn total_leq_nat
      (x : Nat) (y : Nat)
    : Or (Equal Bool (leq_nat x y) True) (Equal Bool (leq_nat y x) True) =
  match x {
    Zero ↦ Inl (Equal Bool (leq_nat Zero y) True) (Equal Bool (leq_nat y Zero) True) Proved;
    Suc x2 ↦
      match y {
        Zero ↦
          Inr
            (Equal Bool (leq_nat (Suc x2) Zero) True)
            (Equal Bool (leq_nat Zero (Suc x2)) True)
            Proved;
        Suc y2 ↦
          match total_leq_nat x2 y2 {
            Inl h ↦
              Inl
                (Equal Bool (leq_nat (Suc x2) (Suc y2)) True)
                (Equal Bool (leq_nat (Suc y2) (Suc x2)) True)
                h;
            Inr h ↦
              Inr
                (Equal Bool (leq_nat (Suc x2) (Suc y2)) True)
                (Equal Bool (leq_nat (Suc y2) (Suc x2)) True)
                h
          }
      }
  }
```

`total`'s field, `IsTrue (bool_or (leq x y) (leq y x))`, is genuinely a
different shape from `total_leq_nat`'s `Or`-of-equalities — `bool_or`
short-circuits on its first argument, so
`bool_or::eq_true_of_or` case-splits on `p` once to compute `bool_or`'s
reduction, then discharges each side directly (the `Inl` branch needs
`cong`/`trans` to carry the equality through `bool_or`'s first-argument
position; the `Inr` branch's own case-split on `p` makes both `bool_or
True q` and `bool_or False q` reduce to a literal, so `Proved`/the hypothesis
itself close it):

```ken
proof eq_true_of_or for bool_or
      (p : Bool) (q : Bool) (h : Or (Equal Bool p True) (Equal Bool q True))
    : IsTrue (bool_or p q) =
  match h {
    Inl hp ↦
      trans
        Bool
        (bool_or p q)
        (bool_or True q)
        True
        (cong Bool Bool p True (λv. bool_or v q) hp)
        Proved;
    Inr hq ↦
      match p {
        True ↦ Proved;
        False ↦ hq
      }
  }

instance Ord Nat {
  leq = leq_nat;
  refl = proof refl for leq_nat;
  antisym = proof antisym for leq_nat;
  trans = proof trans for leq_nat;
  total = λx.λy.proof eq_true_of_or for bool_or (leq_nat x y) (leq_nat y x) (total_leq_nat x y)
}
```

`min` and `max` follow `leq_nat`'s recursion directly. `sub` is saturating
natural-number subtraction, and `compare` returns the three-way result
`OrdResult`:

```ken
data OrdResult = Lt | Eq | Gt

fn min (m : Nat) (n : Nat) : Nat =
  match m {
    Zero ↦ Zero;
    Suc m2 ↦
      match n {
        Zero ↦ Zero;
        Suc n2 ↦ Suc (min m2 n2)
      }
  }

fn max (m : Nat) (n : Nat) : Nat =
  match m {
    Zero ↦ n;
    Suc m2 ↦
      match n {
        Zero ↦ m;
        Suc n2 ↦ Suc (max m2 n2)
      }
  }

fn sub (a : Nat) (b : Nat) : Nat =
  match b {
    Zero ↦ a;
    Suc n ↦
      match a {
        Zero ↦ Zero;
        Suc m ↦ sub m n
      }
  }

fn compare (a : Nat) (b : Nat) : OrdResult =
  match leq_nat a b {
    True ↦
      match leq_nat b a {
        True ↦ Eq;
        False ↦ Lt
      };
    False ↦ Gt
  }
```

## 3. Using it

```ken example
proof two_leq_three for leq_nat : IsTrue (leq_nat (Suc (Suc Zero)) (Suc (Suc (Suc Zero)))) =
  Proved

const min_of_two_and_three : Nat = min (Suc (Suc Zero)) (Suc (Suc (Suc Zero)))

const max_of_two_and_three : Nat = max (Suc (Suc Zero)) (Suc (Suc (Suc Zero)))

const compare_two_three : OrdResult = compare (Suc (Suc Zero)) (Suc (Suc (Suc Zero)))

const compare_three_three : OrdResult = compare (Suc (Suc (Suc Zero))) (Suc (Suc (Suc Zero)))
```

`Ord_instance_Nat` is the dictionary value generated by the
`instance Ord Nat { ... }` declaration. Its `.leq` field is an ordinary value;
the `.total` projection below establishes an `Omega`-typed fact and is therefore
presented as a checked lemma:

```ken example
const ord_nat_leq : Bool = (Ord_instance_Nat).leq (Suc Zero) (Suc (Suc Zero))

theorem ord_nat_total : IsTrue (bool_or (leq_nat (Suc Zero) Zero) (leq_nat Zero (Suc Zero))) =
  (Ord_instance_Nat).total (Suc Zero) Zero
```

## 4. Laws  proofs

`min`/`max`/`sub` earn their place with the computation facts a caller
relies on:

```ken example
proof zero_left for min (n : Nat) : Equal Nat (min Zero n) Zero = Proved

proof zero_left for max (n : Nat) : Equal Nat (max Zero n) n = Refl

proof zero_right for sub (a : Nat) : Equal Nat (sub a Zero) a = Refl
```

`min::zero_left` closes with `Proved`: `min Zero n` reduces to the literal
`Zero`
regardless of `n` (both sides collapse to the same nullary constructor,
`§1` of `catalog/guide/proof-techniques.ken.md`). `max::zero_left` and
`sub::zero_right` close with `Refl`: `max Zero n`'s recursive definition and
`sub`'s own `b = Zero` branch make `n`/`a` (an abstract, stuck variable)
appear literally unchanged on the reduced side without any further
constructor-level reduction — the goal stays `Eq`-shaped, not collapsed to
`Top`.

The companion fact `sub n n = Zero` (self-subtraction) is also true, but —
unlike `sub::zero_right` — needs induction on `n` (`sub`'s own structural
recursion doesn't reduce for an ABSTRACT `n` matched against itself), so
`Refl` alone cannot close it; this entry deliberately doesn't prove that
separately-inductive law, to keep scope small, and names the gap here
rather than carrying an unproved claim:

```ken reject
proof self_is_zero_wrong for sub (n : Nat) : Equal Nat (sub n n) Zero = Refl
```

## 5. Design notes

**Why `refl`/`trans`/`antisym` needed no conversion, but `total` did.**
`class Ord`'s three "pointwise" fields are phrased directly over `IsTrue`,
which unfolds to exactly the shape `leq_nat`'s own proofs already carry
(`Equal Bool … True`) — a byproduct of `IsTrue`'s own definition, not
anything specific to `Nat`. `total`, by contrast, asks for a single
`Bool`-valued disjunction (`bool_or`) rather than a disjoint sum
(`total_leq_nat`'s `Or`) — a genuinely different STATEMENT shape (which side
holds is erased into one Bool, not carried as a tag), so a real conversion
lemma is unavoidable there regardless of carrier. `Ord Bool`'s own `total`
sidesteps this because `Bool`'s order is provable by direct case-split
down to concrete constructors without ever building an intermediate `Or` —
it isn't a template for the `Or`-to-`bool_or` bridge specifically, only
for the overall proof STYLE (case-split to `Proved`/`absurd`), which
`bool_or::eq_true_of_or` also follows.

**Local definitions keep proof terms direct.** The order and arithmetic
operations are written here as structural definitions, so their computation
rules remain visible beside the laws that use them.

3. **Derivation path.** `leq_nat` and its order laws are structural
   definitions and proofs over `Nat`. `bool_or::eq_true_of_or`
   converts the disjoint totality result into the Boolean form required by
   `Ord`. `min`, `max`, `sub`, and `compare` are ordinary recursive
   functions.

   kernel-checked proof term. The entry introduces no `Axiom`, primitive, or
   postulate.
5. **Proof families.** Reflexivity, transitivity, and antisymmetry follow
   the structure of `Nat`; totality uses the two-case Boolean-disjunction
   bridge.
6. **Consumers.** Generic ordered algorithms can use the `Ord Nat` instance;
   direct callers can use the arithmetic and comparison operations.
7. **Validation evidence.** The catalog checks the four `Ord` fields, the
