# System.IO

`System.IO` exposes explicitly positioned, single-transfer buffer I/O.
`readAt` and `writeAt` never maintain a hidden file cursor. `readAt` returns
`ReadEof` or a positive `ReadSome`; `writeAt` returns a positive `Wrote`, while
a zero host write is the distinct `NoProgress` error. `spanBytes` (`freeze`)
copies only the validated current span.

`writeAll` is transparent checked Ken recursion over the constructor-private
`Nat` attempt budget carried by its initial `BufferSpan`. It preserves the first
transfer error unchanged. The five declarations below are ordinary proof terms
checked by the kernel; none is an axiom or a runtime claim. Exactly-once
settlement and liveness remain runtime-enforced, delegated boundary properties.
The exact-prefix proposition observes the loop's private span transition without
exposing a `BufferSpan` producer to source code.
