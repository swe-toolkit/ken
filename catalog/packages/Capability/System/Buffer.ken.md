# System.Buffer

`System.Buffer` presents the immutable checked view of a runtime-owned bounded
buffer. `BufferWindow` is a request descriptor. `BufferSpan` and
`TransferCount` are constructor-private: only the checked transfer boundary can
mint a live span or a positive, request-bounded count. The public projections
expose scalar positions, lengths, structural attempt budgets, and immutable
copies through `spanBytes`/`freeze`; no pointer, slice, file descriptor, mutable
reference, or backing region crosses the boundary.

Fixed capacity, the single-current-window discipline, and invalidation on
settlement are runtime-enforced and externally tested invariants. They are not
stated as kernel proofs. The checked structural budget and count witnesses used
by `writeAll`, however, are ordinary Ken data and their laws are kernel-checked.
