//! Cranelift backend for the runtime IR seed.
//!
//! This module deliberately keeps the native boundary narrow. Cranelift code
//! returns scalar `i64` values directly and aggregate observations through an
//! opaque token table decoded by this Rust layer. Native addresses, object
//! layout, allocation order, ABI details, and Cranelift internals never become
//! Ken-observable meaning.
//!
//! This file holds no test material — that lives in the two gated child
//! modules below. What remains is facade surface (module declarations and
//! re-exports) plus the two inherent `impl` blocks at the foot of the file,
//! which are production code on `surface`'s own types and are reached from
//! `artifact::api`.
//!
//! # Test-only helpers are not public production API
//!
//! `emit_process_entrypoint_object_with_cranelift` is a test-only helper, and
//! that it is not reachable from outside this crate is asserted by
//! `ken-cli/tests/px4b_native_production.rs`, in
//! `naked_process_ir_helpers_are_not_public_production_api`. That test asks
//! the *compiler* the question, by compiling probe snippets against this
//! crate's built rlib; a source-text assertion on the declaration would only
//! test its spelling and would break on every relocation.
//!
//! Both reachable paths are covered there. `lib.rs` re-exports this module
//! with a `pub use cranelift_backend::*`, so a widened item would surface at
//! the crate root as well as under the module path, and a check on one path
//! alone would miss the other:
//!
//! ```text
//! use ken_runtime::cranelift_backend::emit_process_entrypoint_object_with_cranelift as _;   // must not compile
//! use ken_runtime::emit_process_entrypoint_object_with_cranelift as _;                      // must not compile
//! use ken_runtime::cranelift_backend::emit_runtime_ir_object_with_cranelift as _;           // positive control
//! ```
//!
//! ⛔ These fences are `text` on purpose — they are illustration, not a
//! running check. `nextest` does not run doctests and CI has no `--doc` step,
//! so a real `compile_fail` block here would assert the property in a lane
//! that never executes, and a green gate would say nothing about it. The
//! executable form lives in the test named above, which runs in the sharded
//! lane. Keep it that way unless a doctest lane is actually wired up.
