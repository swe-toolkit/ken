///
/// **The question, as it was originally posed.**
/// `exact_continuation_projection`'s `RootIsImmediate` arm copied an `EntryAbi`
/// root's `source_abi_position` straight into `immediate_slot`, and the

/// with intervening binders prepended** — not the entry ABI operand run. So the
/// copy was only sound at zero binder depth, and every population before `D4a`
/// was at zero binder depth.
///
/// **`RootIsImmediate` is RETIRED, on parent and candidate alike.** What
/// determines direct-emission availability today is
/// `resolve_direct_emission_claim` reading `nearest_alias_index` off a
/// `ContinuationEnvironmentClaim::CurrentLexical` — an index into the emitting
/// environment. A root ABI position no longer decides it.
///
/// **`source_abi_position` is NOT retired, and this paragraph previously said
/// it was.** It remains lawful production provenance: the root component of
/// `ContinuationSourceCoordinate::EntryAbi`, consumed outside any `cfg(test)`
/// gate — the planner's exact-source re-derivation locates an owner's entry
/// slot by matching on it. What retired is the **substitution**: using that
/// root coordinate as an index into the emitter's own environment. Only the
/// substitution is `cfg(test)` mutation material, and it is the only thing this
/// observatory reconstructs. The distinction has to be stated, in both
/// directions: a reader who takes the retirement to cover the field goes
/// looking for dead production code that is load-bearing, and a reader who
/// takes the substitution as live files a production defect that does not
/// exist.
///
/// **The oracle, and why it is independent.** Production already records the
/// entry ABI operands, in ABI-position order, at unit entry: `D5a` built
/// `defining_abi_operands` from the same single slot walk that seeds the entry
/// environment, so "index `i` is ABI position `i`" holds there by construction.
/// `RT-SRCBODY-BIND-ORDER` `D1`: that walk now yields TWO orders, and this
/// record keeps the descriptor one. The environment a source body is lowered
/// against is `reverse(Parameter run) ++ Capture run`, so a comparison between
/// the two must go through the derived mapping recorded beside each seat, not
/// through a shared index.
/// That record is keyed by ABI position and never by an environment index, so
/// comparing it against the emission environment **at the position derived from
/// the descriptor** is a comparison of two independently-derived answers to
/// "which value is this", not a walk checked against itself. Reading the

// Architect named across blocks `#1`–`#6`: *every representation authority must
// be the sole authority actually consumed by the production path it governs,
// and every admitted partition must have one total executable lifecycle.*
//
// ⭐ **Why this is a type and not a table.** The proof shape RECUT 2 retires is
// a hand-maintained matrix that can drift from the production enums. So the row
// set here is not written down: it is **derived** by iterating
// [`BoundaryInput::all`] and classifying, and the phases are **struct fields
// with no default**. A row that cannot say what closes a phase does not
// compile, and a new outcome or a new phase is a compile error rather than a
// row nobody added.
//

// compiler closes *completeness* — that every required phase is bound. It does
// **not** close *identity* — that the bound anchor is the real production item
// rather than a lookalike. Identity is closed by named causal controls, and

/// surface a new producer would actually see:
///
/// ```text
/// RUSTFLAGS='--cfg ken_ac10_production_mint_probe' \
///   ./scripts/ken-cargo build -p ken-runtime
/// ```
///
/// **Expected, and MEASURED on rustc 1.96.0 at this SHA:** exactly ONE error,
/// `E0599: no associated function ... named `for_control` ... in the current
/// scope`, on `refused_raw_mint`. `warranted_rebuild` compiles silently.
///
/// ⇒ **MEASURED:** production cannot reach the unconstrained mint.
/// **CLAIMED:** every production span is therefore *constructed* either by
/// [`SafeByteSpan::masked_at_producer`] or by a caller already holding one,
/// since those are the only two production routes.
/// **THE GAP — and `warranted_rebuild` is BOTH SIDES OF IT.** It proves the
/// refusal is about *minting* rather than about the fixture: it builds a
/// `ResponseBytes` in this same module and compiles, because it is handed a span
/// that already exists. The same three lines are the counterexample to the
/// stronger reading — its `pointer` and `len` are locally constructed and
/// unrelated to `existing`, and it compiles anyway. **So this probe witnesses
/// closure of the construction authority and simultaneously shows that the
/// VALUES are not constrained.** A positive control and a counterexample can be
/// the same code; do not read this probe as evidence of value provenance.
///
/// **This probe carries ONE refusal on purpose — measured, not assumed.** It
/// first also carried the braced literal, and enabling it reported only the
/// `E0599`: the resolution failure aborts the compilation before the privacy
/// pass runs, so the `E0451` never appeared and a reader counting errors would
/// have concluded the braced literal was *accepted* here. One refusal per probe
/// is the only shape that cannot mask its sibling. The braced literal is
/// witnessed separately by `ac10_evasion_probe`, and the privacy that refuses it
/// is module-scoped — `lowering` and its descendants are alike outside
/// `safe_byte_span` — so that probe covers this position too.
///
/// **The production profile is the only one that can see this.** Under
/// `--all-targets` the lib-test target enables `cfg(test)`, `for_control`

        // `D8p` retired that too, by putting this seam on the source machine's
        // call edge. The composed route now hosts a checked-IH invocation
        // marker, binds it, and emits the call: see the `D8p` rows.
        //
        // ⛔ `D8f` is still not discharged, and the reason has moved off this
        // seat. Its two-call witness now reaches the affine causal law -- "one
        // causal identity was discharged twice in a single function" -- because
        // the ordinary call re-uses a binding that carries a composed authority.
        // That is a question about the ordinary call's discharge, not about
        // occupancy, and this gate's answer is no longer what blocks it.
        //
        // Route 1 -- a NON-COMPOSED checked wrapper (`px8tr`), which hosts the
        // invocation marker green. Nesting an ordinary call on the same recursor
        // binder inside the marker's application refuses in plan validation with
        // "oriented segment mixes checked and inferred computational frames",
        // detail `(Some(7), None, ...)`. The ordinary call instantiates a
        // semantic IH layer, and a segment carrying any checked frame requires
        // every semantic layer to carry a checked invocation id. ⇒ **The call
        // that must leave the marker pending is exactly the call that would have
        // to have consumed one.**
        //
        // Route 2 -- a COMPOSED checked wrapper. OPEN since `D8p`. It refused at
        // `finish_checked_computational_ih_marker` with "a checked
        // computational-IH marker is a specialized-only surface", because the
        // ordinary unit body that lowers the case body reached the application
        // through the source machine, whose call edge did not consult this seam.
        // It does now, so the marker is consumed there and the route carries the
        // occupancy witness.
        //
        // Route 3 -- a COMPOSED static-worker call as the checked application's
        // argument, so the seat is reached without instantiating an IH layer.

    /// The gate (Architect `dec_5zjh9675253pj`) is that the view must be

    /// transported across one. `D5` discharges it by showing the invalidating
    /// operation **is not expressible in the window**, which is stronger than
    /// ordering the emitted calls carefully:
    ///
    /// 1. **What invalidates is Rust-side and takes `&mut BoundaryValueStore`.**
    ///    `BoundaryRegion::reserve` (`boundary_value.rs`) is what resizes
    ///    `data`, and a resize is what moves the table under the pointer.
    ///    `publish_persistent`'s own note — *"invalidated by any later
    ///    materialization or reservation"* — is about those methods.
    /// 2. **Emitted code cannot reach them.** A compiled body holds a raw arena
    ///    pointer and may call only the CLOSED, pinned `BOUNDARY_LOCAL_HELPERS`
    ///    inventory. That inventory has no reserve, grow, resize or publish
    ///    entry, and its allocator refuses at `ARENA_NODE_CAPACITY` /
    ///    `ARENA_DATA_CAPACITY` rather than reallocating.
    /// 3. ⇒ **Within one emitted host-effect body no reservation or
    ///    materialization of the persistent image can occur at all**, so the
    ///    pointer this returns cannot outlive one. It is stored into the wire
    ///    request and consumed by the `host_dispatch` call in the same body.
    ///
    /// The ordering is worth stating exactly, because this lowering *does*
    /// allocate into the carrier — just never in the window. Operand lowering
    /// allocates BEFORE the claim group opens, and reply decoding allocates
    /// AFTER dispatch returns. Between the observation and the dispatch the arm
    /// emits only stack stores, constants, comparisons and other read-only
    /// observers. **Even so, the window argument is the weaker half:** point 2
    /// is what makes an invalidating operation unspellable there, and it holds
    /// however the arm is later reordered.
    ///
    /// **The residual, stated rather than buried:** this is a proof about the
    /// EMITTED window, not about the Rust harness around it. A test rig that
    /// holds a returned pointer in Rust across a `reserve_persistent` is still
    /// reading a moved table — `d4_observe` documents exactly that trap and
    /// copies while the store is alive. **Widening this inventory with a
    /// growing helper would retire the proof**, which is why it rests on the

    /// was handed.
    ///
    /// ⭐⭐ **THE OUTCOME IS THREE-VALUED, and that is the whole point.** `D3`
    /// answers a word that never denoted a byte span and a well-formed span
    /// that fails containment with DIFFERENT statuses, and a caller must not be
    /// able to read one off the other. So this does **not** funnel the status
    /// through [`Self::require_i64`] — that collapses every refusal into one
    /// failure return and would destroy the distinction the helper exists to
    /// make. The discriminant is:
    ///
    /// | outcome | meaning |
    /// |---|---|
    /// | `0` | the span is observable; pointer and length are live |
    /// | `1` | a WELL-FORMED byte span that failed a bounds rule |
    /// | `2` | the word never denoted a byte span at all |
    ///
    /// ⚠ On any non-zero outcome the pointer and length are `0`, so a caller
    /// that ignores the discriminant reads a null span rather than a plausible
    /// one — the failure is loud rather than silently wrong.
    ///
    /// **THE OUTCOME-`2` COLLAPSE, DECIDED BY `D5` RATHER THAN INHERITED.**
    /// `D3` minted four statuses; outcome `2` merges three of them — `ERR_TAG`,
    /// `ERR_CLASS` and `ERR_ESCAPE` — and the row label above is loose for the
    /// last, since an invocation-owned byte span *is* a byte span, just not one
    /// this helper may safely view.
    ///
    /// **`D5` keeps the collapse, deliberately, and the reason is that nothing
    /// downstream can express the distinction.** Per-seat activation maps a
    /// refusal onto a `ResourceErrorV1` code in the wire reply, and Ken's
    /// surface has no constructor that separates "wrong tag" from "wrong class"
    /// from "invocation-owned". All three mean the same thing to a program: this
    /// carried word is not a span this operation may read, decided before any
    /// host dispatch. Splitting them would need a fourth outcome here, a fourth
    /// reply code, and a Ken-visible constructor to receive it — three changes
    /// to carry a distinction no consumer can currently observe.
    ///
    /// ⇒ **What `D5` does NOT collapse is outcome `1` against outcome `2`.**
    /// Those two select *different* reply codes
    /// ([`RESOURCE_ERROR_INVALID_BOUNDS`] and
    /// [`RESOURCE_ERROR_MALFORMED_RESOURCE`]), each reaching the program as the
    /// payload of an `IOError::Other` on the operation's own declared error
    /// surface, so the separation `D3` built the bounds status for survives all
    /// the way into a value a Ken program can match on. That last clause is
    /// witnessed, not asserted:
    /// `d5_the_two_byte_span_refusals_are_distinct_typed_values_without_dispatch`
    /// observes the two codes and reddens if either collapses.
    ///
    /// **If a later node needs an escape refusal diagnosed distinctly, the
    /// information is gone by this point and the change belongs in `D3`'s status
    /// set, not here.**
