//! The representation and call-ABI contract for values crossing a generated
//! function boundary — declared, validated, and **inert**.
//!
//! `RT-FNSPLIT-B2O` landed the authority this plane consumes: the validated
//! `SemanticOwner` partition. This module attaches a **frame layout** to each
//! `PredeclaredFunction` in that partition.
//!
//! ⛔ **The population is the owner partition, never a source-text census.** The
//! authority for "what is a function unit" is the occurrence's
//! `StaticOriginId`, its validated `SemanticOwner`, and the planned edge kind —
//! never a Rust signature, name, visibility, or file. A pin over this module
//! that reddens because a Rust method was renamed, wrapped, made private, or
//! moved between files is measuring source topology and reporting success.
//!
//! ⛔ **Inert.** Nothing here emits. There is no `FunctionBuilder`, no
//! `define_function`, no call edge, no dispatch edge, no encoder and no decoder.
//! `RT-FNSPLIT-B2F` performs the atomic switch-over; this node only makes the
//! contract expressible and checkable before it does.

/// claim — every frame has all three and always will. The claim `AC-4` needs is

/// projected input run**, which is the run whose values cross into the fused
/// definition from outside. `StoreHandle` is refused on the same footing: a
/// store handle is the persistent lane, and a fused region exports only
/// closure-free final data.
///
/// **MEASURED:** every projected input's carrier is `ValueWord` or
/// `GroundValueCarrier`.
/// **CLAIMED:** no activation, cursor, selection or unwind state enters the
/// generated definition's slot, carrier or parameter lanes from outside.
/// **THE GAP:** this pins the **input run**. The fused frame's own convention
/// tail still carries the three activation words, and must — they are what the
