//! `RT-FNSPLIT-B2V` — the executable boundary-value ABI.
//!
//! `RT-FNSPLIT-B2O` gave the static owner partition; `RT-FNSPLIT-B2R` gave the
//! slot order, width and declared ownership of an activation frame. **Neither
//! said what the bits of an `AbiCarrier::ValueWord` or `ResultWord` MEAN**, nor
//! how compiled code inspects a dynamic aggregate. Hard-stop `#10` measured the
//! consequence: a compiled-once callee cannot consume the `Constructor` and
//! `HostResult` values that actually cross a boundary, because `Lowered` is a
//! **compile-time specialization lattice** and the one aggregate path that works
//! today works only because *the consumer is Rust* (`ResultDecoder` +
//! `result_table` in `CompiledModule`).
//!
//! This module supplies the missing half: **one closed 64-bit tagged word** for
//! every source-valued boundary transfer, together with the flat tables emitted
//! code reads it out of and writes it into. The CLIF side lives in
//! [`crate::boundary_value_clif`]; the two are one deliverable and must not be
//! separated — a representation without an executable interface is exactly the
//! shape that produced `#9` and then `#10` one layer down.
//!
//! ## The word
//!
//! ```text
//! bits [0..8)   tag      — BoundaryTag, a closed repr(u8) enum
//! bits [8..64)  payload  — immediate scalar, or a node index in the REGION
//!                          the tag names
//! ```
//!
//! ## ⭐ Two regions, because a word's lifetime is part of its meaning
//!
//! A handle's index is meaningless without knowing which table it indexes, and
//! the tag is what says. There are exactly two:
//!
//! | tag band | region | lives as long as |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Persistent*` | [`BoundaryPersistentImage`], owned by [`BoundaryValueStore`] | the store |
//! | `Invocation*` | [`BoundaryArenaV1`] | the native invocation |
//!
//! ⛔ **A persistent word must not be an index into invocation storage.** The
//! escape check permits a persistent word to leave the invocation; if its
//! payload named an arena node, the word it permitted out would name freed
//! storage the moment the arena died. The region split is what makes the
//! permission and the lifetime agree, and it is why the arena carries a
//! *pointer to* persistent storage rather than containing any.
//!
//! **Immediate where lawful, opaque handle otherwise.** The split mirrors the
//! one `spec/40-runtime/41-values.md` already draws and `values.rs` already
//! implements — *"scalars are immediate; compounds are content-addressed"* — so
//! the boundary word does not invent a second value taxonomy.
//!
//! ## ⛔ The representation is never chosen by inspecting a value
//!
//! `AC-2`. A tag is a function of the **class** of a transfer and of magnitude
//! bounds that emitted code re-derives at runtime; it is never a function of a
//! particular JIT-time seed value or of caller depth. This is enforced
//! structurally rather than by assertion: [`BoundaryWord::immediate`] and
//! [`BoundaryArenaBuilder`] take a class and a payload and **nothing else** —
//! neither `NativeSeedEnvironment` nor any environment vector is in scope in
//! this module, and the module does not import one. The `B2R` seed-environment
//! discharge took exactly this form and was the strongest thing in that node.
//!
//! ## Two owners, and they are different questions
//!
//! `D2`/`AC-6`. *Who owns the frame slot that stores the word* is `B2R`'s
//! question and its answer is `AbiStorageOwner`. *Who owns the thing the word
//! points at* is this module's question and its answer is
//! [`BoundaryReferentOwner`]. ⛔ `AbiStorageOwner::ActivationFrame` must never
//! stand in for the second: a persistent referent outlives the frame whose slot
//! held the word, and a borrowed one dies with the invocation even though the
//! slot is frame-owned exactly as before.
