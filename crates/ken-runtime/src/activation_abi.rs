//! **`RT-FNSPLIT-C3-ACTIVATION` `D2` — the small C ABI over an opaque
//! activation handle.**
//!
//! ⭐ **C stores an opaque pointer and status values, and nothing else.** That
//! is the whole point of `§3a`: the existing generated C already **duplicates**
//! `struct KenNativeIntArenaV1` twice and **constructs** an arena itself, and
//! the ruling says to **subsume** that precedent, ⛔ not repeat it. So no arena,
//! services or activation layout crosses into C — only handles.
//!
//! ## The two scopes survive the crossing
//!
//! `S2` measured that the persistent image is **store**-lifetime while the
//! arenas are **invocation**-lifetime. ⇒ The C ABI keeps both, rather than
//! flattening them into one call and re-introducing the bug at the boundary:
//!
//! ```text
//! ken_boundary_store_v1_open(profile, &store)      // once per store
//! ken_activation_v1_begin(store, &activation)      // once per activation
//! ken_activation_v1_services(activation, &services)
//! ken_activation_v1_finish(activation, store, ...)
//! ken_activation_v1_destroy(activation)
//! ken_boundary_store_v1_destroy(store)
//! ```
//!
//! ## ⛔ The profile is the ONE layout C is allowed to know
//!
//! `§4` bans a second copy of the **arena, services, native-`Int` or
//! activation** layouts in generated C. ⚠ The profile is not among them, and
//! `D5` explicitly contemplates the stub *"embedding those already-authorized
//! numbers"*. ⇒ [`KenBoundaryResourceProfileV2`] is deliberately the only
//! `#[repr(C)]` struct that crosses.
//!
//! ⭐ And it carries its own `version` and `size` so a C/Rust disagreement
//! **fails closed** rather than being read under a layout it does not have —
//! ⛔ nine bare positional `u64` parameters would have reintroduced exactly the
//! transposition hazard that `BoundaryRegionLimitsV1`'s named fields removed,
//! in the one language with no help against it.
