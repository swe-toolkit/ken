//! **`RT-FNSPLIT-B2F` `S6` — the generated-code activation-services record.**
//!
//! ⭐ **Architect ruling (relayed `evt_e300y2kjeb6k`): the boundary carrier gets
//! its own fixed host-context binding, and it is ⛔ never the native-`Int`
//! arena.** [`crate::native_int::NativeIntArenaV1`] and
//! [`crate::boundary_value::BoundaryArenaV1`] are different runtime objects with
//! different layouts and different ownership; a single `arena` binding that
//! served both was a false equality, retracted in
//! [`crate::cranelift_backend`]'s `carrier_arena` accessor.
//!
//! ## What this record is, and what it deliberately is not
//!
//! ⛔ **It is not a Ken value and it is not part of the `B2R` activation
//! frame.** Arenas are *host runtime services*. The `B2R` program activation
//! frame gains no arena slot, and no arena ever enters a `Parameter` / `Capture`
//! transfer — those carry source-valued bindings only. This record travels
//! beside the frame, as a second fixed parameter, precisely so that the
//! program-derived frame schema and the uniform non-program-derived service
//! context stay structurally separate.
//!
//! ⛔ **The two fields are distinct and typed.** Not one polymorphic `arena`,
//! not two raw positional parameters, not an emitter-selected pointer. The
//! generated code's calling convention is uniform:
//!
//! ```text
//! root / unit: (frame_ptr, services_ptr) -> i64
//! ```
//!
//! and every descendant unit receives the **unchanged** `services_ptr`.
//!
//! ## Why the offsets are derived from an inventory rather than written down
//!
//! ⭐ Same discipline as [`crate::boundary_value::RegionHeaderField`]: the field
//! order is a closed enum, the offsets are `const fn`s over it, and
//! [`ACTIVATION_SERVICES_BYTES`] is computed from the inventory's length. ⇒ A
//! field added later cannot leave a stale offset constant behind, because there
//! is no offset constant that was not derived. ⚠ That is a *layout* proof only;
//! the agreement between this inventory and the `#[repr(C)]` struct below is a
//! separate claim, and it is measured by
//! `the_record_fields_sit_at_the_offsets_emitted_code_loads` rather than
//! asserted here.
