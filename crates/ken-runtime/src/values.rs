/// ⛔ `Clone` is **not** derived — see the hand-written iterative
/// [`Clone`] impl below. The derived one recursed through the nested child
/// collections and overflowed the host stack on a deep value; `Drop` and
/// [`fmt::Debug`] have the same hazard and the same treatment.
///
/// ⛔ **`Debug` is not derived either** (`AC-V11`), and that is the one most
/// easily re-added by reflex: a `#[derive(Debug)]` here compiles, reads as
/// harmless, and silently restores a host-recursive traversal reachable from
/// every `{:?}` in a panic handler or log line.
///
/// ⚠ The recursive **child positions** of this enum (`args`, `fields`,
/// `elements`, and `Map`'s entry values) are governed by the closed allow-list
/// in `canonical::child_positions`. Giving one of them reference / handle /
/// arena / slot / index indirection, or interior mutation, **will not compile**
/// — that is deliberate, and it is what keeps the unrepresentability of cycles
/// on this carrier from silently lapsing.
///
/// ⛔ **`PartialEq`/`Eq`/`PartialOrd`/`Ord`/`Hash` are NOT derived, and that is
/// `D3`.** They were, and they were **unsound** — independently of closures.
/// Two `BigInt`s `{limbs: [5]}` and `{limbs: [5, 0]}` encode to *identical*
/// canonical bytes (`minimal_limbs` strips trailing zero limbs) and compared
/// **unequal** under the derive; two NFC-distinct spellings of one `String` did
/// the same. ⇒ The derived relations **disagreed with canonical identity**,
/// which is exactly what `AC-V8` forbids.
///
/// ⭐ Equality, order and hash are therefore exposed **only** on
/// [`CanonicalWitness`], which *is* the canonical bytes. Agreement is
/// **definitional** rather than asserted — there is no second definition of
/// identity to keep in step — and comparison is **depth-total** because the
/// bytes come from P1's iterative encoder and comparing a flat `Vec<u8>`
/// recurses not at all (`AC-V12`).
///
/// # `AC-V4` — the forbidden capabilities are UNREACHABLE on this carrier
///
/// ⭐ **The claim is *reachability*, not the absence of a caller today**, so
/// every control below must fail to **compile**. ⭐ And each pins the **trait
/// implementation** rather than one operator spelling: a bound check
/// `fn requires_eq<T: PartialEq>` cannot be evaded by writing `a.eq(b)`,
/// `PartialEq::eq(a, b)`, or an inherent method, because the only way to make
/// it compile is to supply the impl — which *is* the forbidden capability.
///
/// **Execution inventory:** CI executes all four `AC-V4` `compile_fail` fences
/// below (`Value::Closure` cannot be named, and no `PartialEq`, `Ord`, or
/// `Hash`) together with their compiling sibling through the workspace doctest
/// gate. The sibling is the positive control that keeps malformed fixtures from
/// silently greening the negative fences.
///
/// ⛔ **The `EXXXX` codes below are DOCUMENTATION, not a check — measured, not
/// assumed.** Rewriting one block's `compile_fail,E0277` to `compile_fail,E0308`
/// — a code that block cannot possibly produce — left the doc-test **green**,
/// so rustdoc is not binding the annotation on this toolchain. They are kept
/// because they tell a reader which error is expected, and flagged here because
/// a fence that *looks* like a pin and is not one is worse than no fence.
///
/// ⇒ **MEASURED:** each block fails to compile, for some reason.
/// **CLAIMED:** it fails *because the trait impl is absent*.
/// **THE GAP:** closed by the **sibling**, not by the code annotation — the
/// sibling shares every import, helper and constructor, so a malformed fixture
/// reddens *it* instead of silently greening the negatives. The `Value::Closure`
/// block additionally has a direct non-vacuity control: substituting a variant
/// that *does* exist makes it compile, and the doc-test then fails.
///
/// ⛔ **An ordinary closure cannot even be NAMED here (`D1`)** — the variant
/// does not exist, so there is no value for a comparison to be about:
///
/// ```compile_fail,E0599
/// use ken_runtime::Value;
/// let _closure = Value::Closure { captured: vec![Value::Bool(true)] };
/// ```
///
/// **No structural equality (`D3`):**
///

/// fn requires_eq<T: PartialEq>(_: &T) {}
/// let v = Value::Record { type_id: 1, fields: vec![Value::Bool(true)] };

/// ```
///
/// **No ordering (`D3`):**

/// ```
///
/// ⭐ **The sibling that MUST compile — without it, every block above is green
/// whether it failed for the stated reason or because the fixture was
/// malformed.** ⛔ A `compile_fail` block passes for *any* compilation error,
/// including a mistyped path or a missing import, so a negative-only set of

/// Iterative rendering (`AC-V11`).
///
/// ⛔ **`Debug` is not derived**, because the derived impl recursed through the
/// nested child collections and aborted the process on a deep value. That is a
/// worse failure than it first reads: every *other* deep traversal left on this
/// carrier is reached from a deliberate call — an identity comparison, an encode
/// — whereas `{:?}` is reached from a **panic handler, a log line, or an
/// `assert_eq!` failure message**. ⇒ The abort fires while a maintainer is
/// diagnosing something else, and it destroys the diagnostic being produced.
///
/// ⭐ **The mechanism, which is the claim — not any particular depth.** The only
/// stack frames here are `fmt` → `debug_header`, one deep, for *every* node: a
/// node's children are pushed onto the heap-allocated `stack` and popped by the
/// same loop, never visited by a nested call. Host-stack usage is therefore
/// O(1) in value depth, and depth is bounded by allocation — an ordinary
/// resource boundary — exactly as it is for `Clone`, `Drop` and the canonical
/// encoder. ⛔ There is no `MAX_DEPTH`.
///
/// ⚠ Corroboration, **not** the pin: the landed derived impl was measured dying
/// of stack overflow at `D = 131072` out of process, and the replacement returns
/// at that same `D`. A finite probe supports a structural claim; it does not
/// constitute one.
///
/// ⚠ **The rendered text is unspecified and must not be pinned.** It is kept
/// byte-identical to the derived rendering for `{:?}` as a courtesy to existing
/// logs, but the claim under test is *does it return*, not *what does it print*.
///
/// ⛔ **One deliberate, stated difference: `{:#?}` is no longer pretty-printed.**
/// [`fmt::Formatter::alternate`] is not consulted, so the alternate flag renders
/// the same single-line text as `{:?}`. This is a **degradation, not a
/// regression**: before this impl, `{:#?}` on a deep value aborted the process
/// rather than printing anything at all.
///
/// ⛔ **This is NOT because honoring `alternate` is impossible here** — it is
/// not. Carrying a depth field on each [`DebugStep`] and pushing indent literals
/// would do it; nothing about the worklist precludes it. An earlier draft of
/// this comment argued impossibility, and that claim was false.
///
/// ⭐ The real ground, ruled by the Steward on `RT-VALUE-TOTALITY-P3`: this is a
/// capability the rewrite **did not carry forward, on a surface with no
/// consumers**. Re-measured independently at `0031dd6a`, excluding `local/` and
/// `target/`: **no call site anywhere in the repo requests alternate `Debug`
/// formatting**, and **no `.rs` file under `crates/` consults
/// `Formatter::alternate`** — the one other hand-written `Debug` in this crate
/// (`boundary_value.rs`) does not either. So the degradation is unconsumed and
/// consistent with workspace precedent.
///
/// ⚠ If you re-run those probes on *this* tree they will not come back empty:
/// this comment is itself prose containing the pattern. Measure at a commit
/// without it, or match call sites rather than the raw token — the same
/// grep-fires-on-the-prose-that-denies-it trap the fleet has hit before.
///
/// ⚠ What *would* be a mistake is restoring a pretty layout by guesswork:
/// reconstructing the derive's exact newline and indent placement has no
/// verifiable oracle short of a snapshot, and inventing a *different* layout
/// would mint new unspecified surface during a totality WP. If pretty-printing
/// is wanted back, it is a separate change that must first decide whether the
/// layout is specified.
