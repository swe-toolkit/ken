//! **`RT-FNSPLIT-C3-ACTIVATION` `D4` — the deployment-supplied capacity
//! authority for boundary storage.**
//!
//! ⭐ **This type exists because the authority it names did not.** The prior
//! arena ruling asserted that *"the existing store/plan capacity authority
//! grants storage"*; measurement found that phrase has no referent —
//! `BoundaryRegion::reserve(nodes, words, data, limbs)` takes four
//! **caller-supplied** numbers, and no landed function derives them from a plan,
//! a store, or a program. ⇒ Someone has to create that authority, and `§3c`
//! rules that it is **deployment resource policy**, ⛔ not compiler semantics
//! and ⛔ not an emitter-derived formula.
//!
//! ## Eight region limits, one epoch limit, and two call-event limits
//!
//! Two regions — the **invocation** arena and the **persistent** image — each
//! meter nodes, child words, data bytes, and native-`Int` limbs. These are the
//! eight region limits, exactly the eight reserve arguments. The process
//! additionally meters activation epochs independently across all stores;
//! ending one store cannot replenish this process-wide budget. Each activation
//! separately limits call-event generations and live pending-call slots.
//!
//! ## ⛔ No default, and that is enforced by the compiler rather than by review
//!
//! [`BoundaryResourceProfileV3`] deliberately has **no `Default` impl** and
//! **no partial constructor**, and its limits are named public fields. ⇒ Every
//! construction site must write all eleven limits out, and there is no
//! `..Default::default()` to hide behind. ⚠ A `new()` taking four same-typed
//! `usize` positionals would have been the transposition hazard this shape
//! removes: swapping *words* and *data bytes* would compile, run, and be wrong.
//!
//! ⛔ **The emitter may validate and carry a selected profile; it may not
//! invent, widen, or silently default one.** Absence is a configuration refusal
//! **before packaging or activation** — ⛔ never a linked executable that starts
//! and then declines to run generated code.
//!
//! ## ⚠ Zero is a legal limit
//!
//! A limit of `0` is **explicit and finite**, and means *"no room for this
//! resource"*. It is a deployment's right to say so, and the first construction
//! that needs the resource fails loudly naming it. ⛔ Zero is not treated as
//! "unset" — conflating the two is how a default sneaks back in.
