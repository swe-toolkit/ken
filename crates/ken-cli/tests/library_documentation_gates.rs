//! Wave 0 documentation gates (`docs/program/issues/DOC-W0.md` deliverable
//! 5, proposal "Documentation gates" 1/2/3/6), plus what librarian QA
//! (`thr_74hvpkqnxjp9q`) found the first cut left open:
//!
//! 1. the manifest covers every `library/` document and every manifest
//!    path exists;
//! 1b. every manifest record declares the complete required shape (kind,
//!     audience, authority, availability, sources, validation, owner —
//!     all non-empty) and no `path` repeats (AC1: a page whose fields
//!     can silently go missing is not "declaring what it is").
//! 1c. `validation` is a closed, known vocabulary that names exactly all
//!     registered record-validation gates that apply to that record — not
//!     free prose (AC1: "how its currency is checked" must be mechanical).
//! 1d. no manifest scalar/array-string value contains a literal `|` —
//!     the generator's row transport delimiter — so gate and generator
//!     can't silently disagree about where one field ends and the next
//!     begins.
//! 2. internal links resolve to a real file **and a real anchor**
//!    (same-file or cross-file), and external links are syntactically
//!    well-formed;
//! 3. every manifest `sources` entry's path exists, and its `#anchor` (if
//!    any) names a real heading in that file — the drift gate D1 requires;
//! 6. every registered document labels an `availability` of exactly
//!    current/partial/planned/unavailable.
//! 7. every manifest `sources` entry cited by a non-`status`-kind document
//!    is byte-unchanged between `library/REVISION` and `HEAD` — `revision_
//!    resolved()` (DOC-W0) only proves `REVISION` names a real ancestor
//!    commit; it never reads a cited source's bytes AT that revision, so
//!    it is blind to content drift under an unchanged heading
//!    (`DOC-CURRENCY-ANCHOR`). A `status`-kind document (`STATUS.md`) is
//!    exempt from this token entirely (it carries `generated-current`
//!    instead — always regenerated fresh, so idempotency subsumes it), and
//!    `library/REVISION` itself is the one path-level exemption (self-
//!    referential by construction); nothing else is exempted by path. A
//!    symlinked source is rejected outright rather than diffed through —
//!    `git diff` on a symlink path compares the symlink's own target-path
//!    blob, not the resolved file's content. Enforced in `scripts/gen-doc-
//!    status.sh`, verified here by driving the real script against
//!    synthetic fixtures — also covers the bootstrap case: `REVISION` must
//!    name a point at or after `library/manifest.toml`'s own introduction,
//!    not merely an ancestor.
//!
//! Targeted `scripts/ken-cargo -p ken-cli` check, not an out-of-band
//! script (doc-leader kickoff, `thr_74hvpkqnxjp9q`). Each gate below is
//! proven to fail on a planted violation in the DOC-W0 handoff — see the
//! before/after pasted there; this file is the gate's resting (green)
//! state.
//!
//! Two substrate-soundness properties Architect review added
//! (`dec_4hrvf6bkce8fk`): this parser's `[[document]]`/`key =`
//! recognition is anchored at column 0, byte-identical to
//! `scripts/gen-doc-status.sh`'s awk grammar, so a manifest record either
//! parses the same way on both sides or is rejected by gate 1b on
//! neither — the two can no longer silently disagree. And every path
//! (document `path`, `sources`, internal links) resolves through
//! `resolve_confined`, which rejects an absolute target or a `..` climb
//! past the repository root before ever touching the filesystem, so an
//! existing host file outside the repo can't satisfy a manifest entry.

// `root.join(rel)` has a sharp Rust `PathBuf` gotcha: if `rel` is
// ABSOLUTE, `join` doesn't concatenate — it REPLACES the base entirely
// (`PathBuf::push` docs). So a manifest `path`/`source` or an internal
// link of `/etc/passwd` silently resolved to the real host file
// `/etc/passwd`, existence-checks and all — an anti-drift gate that is
// host-dependent, not repository-confined. A lexical `..` climb has the
// same effect without even needing an absolute string. Fixed by
// normalizing PURELY LEXICALLY (no filesystem access, so it rejects an
// escape even when the target doesn't exist) and requiring the result
// stay under the repository root.

// outside the repository passes the lexical prefix check (the symlink

// straight through to a real host file — a green-but-host-dependent bypass
// of the same confinement boundary (Architect, `thr_74hvpkqnxjp9q`, third
// round). Fixed by canonicalizing whenever the lexically-confined target
// exists (canonicalization fully resolves symlinks) and re-checking

// `source-currency` does not apply to a `kind = "status"` document at
// all — its currency is what `generated-current` (idempotency: it is
// always regenerated fresh from the current working tree) already
// establishes, which subsumes "unchanged since REVISION" for a document
// that has no independent existence apart from its own generation. Every
// OTHER document's `library/`-referencing sources (none exist today, but

// going green in CI). Fixed by building a fully SYNTHETIC upstream in a
// scratch directory: real git history, the real `gen-doc-status.sh`
// script copied byte-for-byte, its own manifest/REVISION — independent of
// whatever state this test's own checkout happens to be in. The synthetic
// `origin` plays the role CI's real GitHub remote plays for the real

// --- REVISION must survive a squash-merge, not just resolve on the branch --
//
// Landed post-merge outage (thr_15yrvjrpap9td/thr_sq41qedhmtas, adversary
// evt_504x5h9t6veqq, 2026-07-22): `DOC-CURRENCY-ANCHOR` merged with
// `library/REVISION` naming `cc2af484`, the WP branch's own immediate-parent
// commit -- correct on the branch (where the registered `generated-current`
// runner's status-generator check demanded exactly that bump) and where three
// folds, an Architect approval, a Librarian QA pass, and green CI all checked
// it. The publisher
// **squash-merges**: the merged commit's sole parent is the pre-merge `main`
// tip, so no pre-squash branch commit survives as an ancestor of `main`.
// `origin/main` went CI-red on its own documentation gate the moment the
// squash landed -- a property that was true at every check anyone ran and
// became false only after the last one.
//
// Architect ruling (thr_tq8z3dda5khk, evt_2aj7bxb164cp8): the fix is NOT
// "REVISION must equal the candidate's exact/latest merge base" -- that
// overclaims a single canonical value where the real contract is a
// conjunction any qualifying commit `R` can satisfy:
//   1. `R` is a squash-stable ancestor of the integrated tree -- an
//      already-`main` commit, never a candidate-only parent;
//   2. `library/manifest.toml` exists at `R` (the bootstrap check);
//   3. every current non-status document's cited source blob is
//      byte-identical at `R` and `HEAD` (the content-currency check);
//   4. `STATUS.md` is generated from that exact `R`.
// This test proves ONLY predicate 1's topology distinction: a branch-local
// commit (`C1`) does not survive a squash-merge onto `main`, while a
// commit that is already on `main` (`B`) does, by construction, on this
// repository's linear (no-merge-commit) history -- a squash commit `S`'s
// sole parent is always the pre-merge main tip `T`, and any candidate's
// merge base is always `T` or an ancestor of `T`, hence always an ancestor
// of `S`. A bare `merge-base --is-ancestor` assertion on its own would be
// a WEAKER check than this: it must run against a topology that actually
// has the squash-merge shape, which is what this test constructs, rather
// than against the branch (where the bug was invisible by construction).
//
// ⚠ Residual, stated explicitly rather than left implicit: this test
// CANNOT and does not select which on-`main` ancestor is the "right" one
// among several that would all pass it -- it only distinguishes on-`main`
// from branch-local. Predicates 2-4 above are the independent, separately-
// tested acceptance checks (`gate_manifest_rejects_a_field_line_...`,
// `content_currency_gate_rejects_a_drifted_cited_source_and_recovers`,
// `content_currency_gate_rejects_revision_predating_librarys_own_
// introduction`) that narrow "any ancestor of main" down to a valid one.
// Picking `638fe6d4` specifically over some other qualifying ancestor is a
// review judgment (it was the last reviewed DOC-CURRENCY base and
// demonstrably contains the manifest), not a fact this or any test proves.
