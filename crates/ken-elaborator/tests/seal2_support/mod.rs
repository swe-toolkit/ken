//! SEAL-2 — the closed producer-closure oracle, shared by the two SEAL-2 test
//! binaries (`seal2_producer_closure.rs` and `adversary_seal2_repros.rs`).
//!
//! # What this repairs
//!
//! SPAN-SEAL landed a producer-closure oracle for `BufferSpan`
//! (`px8f_buffer_io_surface.rs::public_buffer_span_producers`). The *property*
//! it checks holds — but the *gate* guarantees materially less than the sentence
//! it carries, along three independent axes:
//!
//!   * **namespace** — it iterates `env.globals` only. A class field
//!     (`class_env.classes[C].field_types`) is source-reachable by projection
//!     yet never enters `globals`, so it is invisible.
//!   * **position** — it matches only the *head* of a result type. A
//!     `Result E BufferSpan` producer has the carrier off-head, so it is skipped.
//!   * **source root** — it elaborates only `{prelude, Buffer, IO}`. A producer
//!     in any other catalog package is outside its environment entirely.
//!
//! Each earlier repair *named a mechanism* (a Pi-codomain walk, then
//! `GlobalEnv::lookup`, then "declarations and constructors") and inherited that
//! mechanism's blind spot. The lesson
//! (`an-enumeration-needs-a-proven-closure-not-a-better-grep`) is that a bigger
//! grep is never the fix: you find the *gate every member must pass through* and
//! bind the enumeration to it, so the population cannot silently omit a member.
//!
//! # How each axis is CLOSED here (not merely widened)
//!
//!   * **namespace (AC-2)** — [`enumerate_producer_types`] is bound to
//!     `ElabEnv`'s own fields by an exhaustive struct destructuring with **no
//!     `..`**. Adding a field to `ElabEnv` is a *build break* in this file,
//!     forcing whoever adds it to classify the new namespace. The known-today
//!     producer sources are *fixtures* the discriminators test the walker
//!     against, never the walker's definition.
//!   * **position (AC-3)** — [`result_type_produces`] descends into *every*
//!     sub-position of the result type via an **exhaustive `match` over `Term`**
//!     (no wildcard), WHNF-normalizing at each node so transparent aliases
//!     unfold. A new `Term` variant is a build break; no compound former is ever
//!     skipped or defaulted.
//!   * **source root (AC-4)** — [`catalog_package_files`] globs *every* catalog
//!     package (a root outside the controlled Section allowlist is a loud
//!     failure), and a **derived semantic confinement certificate**
//!     ([`root_facts`] + [`carrier_closure`] + [`assert_confined`]) parses each
//!     root's checked fences and marks a root non-exempt when any declaration
//!     references a carrier-closure name in any type **or body** position (the
//!     body axis is load-bearing — Ken's bottom eliminator can inhabit a carrier
//!     from an ex-falso body), or uses a form the certificate cannot resolve
//!     (`module`/`import`/`export` → fail closed). Its
//!     soundness is the conjunction on [`RootFacts`], not "every producer names
//!     the carrier". A single flat all-catalog `ElabEnv` is not achievable (the
//!     catalog is layered and co-load collides) and is not required; each
//!     non-exempt root is instead enumerated and checked by [`closed_producers`].
//!
//! # AC-5 — loud failure on anything unhandled, per axis
//!
//! The three axes fail closed by the strongest mechanism each admits:
//!   * type-former axis → **compile time** (the wildcard-free `Term` match);
//!   * namespace-member axis → **runtime panic** in [`type_of_global`] when a
//!     `globals` id is neither a declaration nor a constructor;
//!   * source-root axis → **runtime panic** in [`classify_section`] on a root
//!     outside the allowlist.
//! The two runtime panics are pinned by `#[should_panic]` tests; the compile-time
//! one is pinned by the match being exhaustive.

// catalog is layered with boundary headers + cross-package name reuse; an
// arbitrary-order co-load collides — Transport duplicate `sym`, LawfulClasses
// OverlappingInstances DecEq Bool). So the source-root closure is established
// semantically, not by loading every package:
//
//   1. Parse each globbed package's CHECKED Ken fences through the production
//      literate extractor + parser (prose and comments are blanked by the
//      extractor, so they are not evidence). Parsing is purely syntactic — it
//      needs none of the package's dependencies loaded.
//   2. Compute the transitive set of type NAMES that reach a sealed carrier,
//      seeded by the carrier declarations and closed through transparent type
//      aliases and carrier-reaching class/data names (to a fixpoint, across all
//      roots).
//   3. A root is NON-EXEMPT when any declaration references a carrier-closure
//      name in any type OR body position (`walk_decl` scans both — the bottom
//      eliminator makes the body load-bearing), OR uses a form the certificate
//      cannot resolve (`module`/`import`/`export` → `requires_semantic_resolution`,
//      FAIL CLOSED — no surface-string resolver graph). Every non-exempt root is
//      named (root + declaration/form + carrier/reason) and must be explicitly
//      enumerated, loaded through its known dependency environment, and run
//      through `closed_producers` — never silently accepted. The soundness of

/// # Why a conservative scan is sound (the conjunction)
///
/// The certificate does NOT identify producer *positions* (that would require
/// replicating the elaborator's inference / instance / import resolution — where
/// a syntactic approximation leaks). It answers only the coarser question it can
/// decide soundly: **does a declaration reference any carrier-closure name in any
/// type OR body position, or use a form the certificate cannot resolve?** Its
/// soundness is a conjunction, not the false claim "every producer names the
/// carrier in a type position":
///
///   1. AC-2/AC-3 first prove the source-visible *starting* environment
///      (`prelude + Buffer + IO`) contains no carrier producer — every namespace
///      and class field — i.e. `closed_producers` derives `{}` there.
///   2. The carrier constructors are prelude-private (not source-visible). Ken
///      HAS a bottom eliminator — `absurd_empty (C : Type) (e : Empty) : C =
///      match e {}` (`Core/Logic/EmptyDec.ken.md`) inhabits *any* type from a
///      proof of `Empty`, so `fn leak (e : Empty) = absurd_empty BufferSpan e`
///      is a carrier producer with no carrier in any *type* position. But
///      exercising that path to yield a carrier requires naming the carrier (or
///      an alias) as the eliminated motive, which appears as a carrier-closure
///      reference in the declaration's TYPE or BODY. There is no other synthesis
///      path (no cast/forge that manufactures a value of a type it does not name).
///   3. Therefore the *first* producer a catalog root introduces must reference a
///      carrier-closure NAME in some type OR body position — parameter, result,
///      field, constructor argument, alias RHS, class/instance head, a bottom
///      motive in a body, or a closure member reached through those. [`walk_decl`]
///      scans every such position, including declaration bodies. A term-only
///      forwarder (`fn leak = makeSpan`) can exist only *after* an earlier
///      producer, which clause 1 or an earlier admitted root already rejects.
///
/// That conjunction — not body inference — is what licenses an unannotated body
/// with no carrier-closure reference to stay exempt. A root that DOES reference a
/// closure name (in any type or body position), or uses an unresolvable form, is
/// non-exempt: it must be elaborated in its known dependency environment and run
