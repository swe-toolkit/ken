//! DS-5b acceptance: dependent-match index refinement (constructor
//! injectivity + sibling convoy), `docs/program/wp/ds-5b-dependent-match-
//! refinement.md`.
//!
//! `check_match_dependent`'s motive recovery previously refined only the
//! scrutinee's own index (spec `34-data-match §3.2`); it could not (1)
//! re-type a branch's own peeled recursive field via constructor
//! injectivity, or (2) re-type an outer sibling binder sharing the same
//! index (the "convoy" case). Both are carried into the local context via
//! the kernel's own `Eq`/`J`/`Cast` (`16`) — never postulated.
//!
//! Coverage:
//! - AC-injectivity: `tail`-shaped peeled-recursive-field re-typing.
//! - AC-convoy: a sibling binder re-typed through a nested match.
//! - AC-goal: a branch that constructs a fresh family value against an
//!   index-dependent goal (needs its own goal refined, not a context
//!   variable — the third, narrower capability this WP's construction
//!   also required).
//! - AC8: an unlicensed equation is never fabricated — a genuinely
//!   ill-typed program stays kernel-rejected.
//! - Non-indexed inertness: `List`/`Bool` matches are unaffected (implicitly
//!   covered by the full pre-existing suite staying green; direct check
//!   here too).
