//! B1 behavioral-export emitter — the five-part assume-guarantee contract
//! (`spec/70-behavioral/71-assumption-boundary.md §2.1–§5.2`).
//!
//! **Generated, never authored.** Every field is a projection of Ken's verified
//! content. The emitter cannot over-claim: it projects exactly the four-way
//! epistemic status from `21 §5`, with a kernel-side honesty discriminator
//! (`§2.1` I1).
//!
//! **Honesty discriminator (I1, the load-bearing pin):** a claim is in `Q`
//! iff its V1 hole is ABSENT from `trusted_base()` (the postulate was
//! discharged: `upgrade_to_transparent` was called and the cert kernel-
//! checked). A claim whose hole remains in `trusted_base()` is in `P`.
//! Checking `trusted_base()` membership is a structural check on the kernel
//! environment, not a comparison of status strings: a lazy emitter that trusts
//! a V-layer "proved" string (or buckets by presence of an `ensures` clause)
//! would land open holes in `Q` (over-claim). The discriminating pair
//! EX-A1/EX-A2 is the sole net for this discriminator.
//!
//! **One-way gate (I4):** there is no code path from a `Ward`/classical/
//! delegated result to `proved` status. The checked emitter takes only
//! kernel-produced `Verdict` values and the kernel's `trusted_base()` — no
//! external discharge result can enter here and write a `Q` entry. The gate
//! is structural: `QEntry` can only be constructed inside the checked-target
//! export transaction, and
//! only when `trusted_base()` does not contain the hole.
//!
//! **Disproved boundary (71 §2.1):** a refuted claim is never exported. The
//! build is non-shippable when any obligation is `disproved`.
//!
//! **Σ = L5 perform-node signatures (I3):** the alphabet is derived from the
//! selected checked target's closed, target-neutral denotation graph.  The
//! declared effect row remains an admission upper bound and is never an
//! alphabet source or fallback.
//!
//! **G carries support, never measure (I5):** `GEntry` has NO weight/
//! likelihood/probability field. The structural absence makes a measure
//! unrepresentable — a compile error, not a runtime check. This is the
//! exhaustive-by-construction seal (§4.1), the B1 analog of `LeakSink`.
//!
//! **Content-addressed hash (§3.3):** `BehavioralExport::hash` is the
//! SHA-256 of a canonical JSON serialization (deterministic field and entry
//! order). A non-canonical serialization yields a non-reproducible hash.
//! The `sha2` crate is not in scope yet; we use a deterministic canonical
//! string and `DefaultHasher` as a build-internal content-address. `(oracle)`
//! note: the final hash algorithm is Ward-finalized; this implementation pins
//! the _discipline_ (canonical order, no timestamps), not the exact algorithm.
