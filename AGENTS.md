# Working in `swe-toolkit/ken`

Guidance for any Claude Code session (and any agent) operating in this repo.

## Load your role playbook first (every agent, every session)

You are **one role** in a multi-agent federation, and your operating
instructions live in a role-specific **skill**. Before doing any work — and
again **after every context compaction** — orient yourself:

1. Call **`orientation()`** (convo MCP) to learn your **role** (e.g. `steward`,
   `kernel-leader`, `spec-author`) and focus space.
2. Read **`agent/COORDINATION.md`** (federation law) and **`agent/MODELS.md`**
   (model tiers) — binding on every role.
3. **Invoke the skill for your role** (the Skill tool) and follow it as your
   standing playbook — route from your `orientation()` role:

| Your role (from `orientation()`) | Skill to load |
|---|---|
| `steward` | `ken-steward` |
| `lieutenant` | `ken-merge-lieutenant` |
| `architect` | `ken-architect` |
| `librarian` | `ken-librarian` |
| `research` | `ken-research` |
| `adversary` | `ken-adversary` |
| `spec-leader` | `ken-spec-leader` |
| `spec-author` | `ken-spec-author` |
| `conformance-validator` | `ken-conformance-validator` |
| `<team>-leader` — kernel/verify/language/runtime/ergo/foundation/**doc** | `ken-build-leader` |
| `<team>-implementer` | `ken-build-implementer` |
| `<team>-qa` | `ken-build-qa` |

** The `doc` team has no `doc-qa` seat — the `librarian` is its QA.** Its
ring is `doc-leader` + `doc-author` + `librarian`, and the Librarian reviews
the ring's WPs *and* holds a standing as-built mandate no build QA has. So
`librarian` routes to `ken-librarian` (above), **not** to `ken-build-qa`, and
there is no `agent/teams/doc/qa.md`. The doc track is also the one standing
exception to the fleet's single-threaded posture: it **runs concurrently**
with build work (operator, 2026-07-21), on the basis that it touches
`library/` and `agent/` rather than `crates/` — the exception is
contention-free-ness, not priority.

Build-team roles share the `ken-build-*` archetype skills — your team is the
prefix on your role name (`kernel-leader` → `ken-build-leader`). The skills are
the `agent/playbooks/` corpus, surfaced as skills via `.claude/skills/` (Claude
Code) and `.agents/skills/` (Codex) — both symlink into `agent/playbooks/`;
editing a playbook edits its skill. If a team-specific overlay
exists (`agent/teams/<team>/<role>.md`), load it after the archetype skill. The
Steward owns this corpus and its routing.

**If the `Skill` tool reports your skill is unknown:** the skill registry loads
at **session start**, so a skill added or updated mid-session (e.g. you just
`git rebase`d onto a `main` that added it) is not registered for the `Skill`
tool until your next restart. Don't block on it — **`Read` the file directly at
`.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`** (or its `agent/playbooks/` target) and follow
it; it is the identical playbook. A fresh session start registers every skill
for the `Skill` tool. This makes playbook updates self-heal on rebase without a
forced restart.

## Load your memory scopes (every agent, every session)

The federation's hard-won operational lessons live in **`agent/memory/`** — a
curated, scoped corpus (see `agent/memory/README.md`). After loading your
playbook, **read the memory scopes for your role**: your `fleet` scope plus the
narrower scopes on your path (its path + ancestors).

| Your role | Memory scopes to read (the dir's files + its `README.md`) |
|---|---|
| _any role_ | `agent/memory/fleet/` |
| `steward` | `fleet` + `agent/memory/enclave/` + `agent/memory/roles/steward/` |
| `lieutenant` | `fleet` + `agent/memory/build/` (it releases build WPs) |
| `architect` | `fleet` + `enclave` + `agent/memory/roles/architect/` |
| `spec-leader` / `spec-author` / `conformance-validator` | `fleet` + `enclave` + `agent/memory/roles/<role>/` |
| `librarian` | `fleet` + `agent/memory/roles/librarian/` + `agent/memory/teams/doc/` (it is the doc team's QA) |
| `research` | `fleet` + `agent/memory/enclave/` + `agent/memory/roles/research/` |
| `adversary` | `fleet` + `agent/memory/enclave/` + `agent/memory/roles/adversary/` |
| `<team>-leader` | `fleet` + `agent/memory/build/` + `agent/memory/build/leaders/` + `agent/memory/teams/<team>/` |
| `<team>-implementer` | `fleet` + `build/` + `build/implementers/` + `teams/<team>/` |
| `<team>-qa` | `fleet` + `build/` + `build/qa/` + `teams/<team>/` |

These are **lessons, not law** — recall aids that reflect what was true when
written; verify a named file/flag/function still exists before acting on one.
Record a new lesson at the broadest scope where every reader must apply it.
This corpus is the source of truth — Codex's generated `~/.codex/memories/` (if
ever enabled) is supplemental only, never canonical.

## Reference material is off-limits to code authors

`local/refs/` (gitignored) holds reference implementations. **Do not read them
to write Ken's code.** Per `CLEAN-ROOM.md`:

- **The AGPLv3 prototype (`yon`) is NOT mounted in this environment.** It
  is the *excluded inspiration* — Ken's design is its own; `yon` is not a
  consultable reference. There is zero AGPLv3 contact, which is strictly
  cleaner. **No agent should go looking for it.**
- **The permissive references** (Lean, Agda, cooltt, smalltt, cctt, …) may be
  **read to understand** by the Architect / Spec enclave, **the research agent,
  and the adversary agent** (the adversary for known prior-art failure modes) to
  sharpen the spec / hunt flaws, but **not copied** into the repo. Implementer
  agents build from `/spec`, never from `local/refs/`.
- **Copyleft references** (GPL/AGPL/CeCILL — e.g. smtcoq, spot, jif) are for the
  **Spec enclave, the research agent, and the adversary agent only**, for
  approach and behavior only, under the leakage recheck. Never consulted by
  implementer agents, never vendored.

When unsure whether you may look at something under `local/refs/`, the answer
is no — ask the operator or the Spec enclave.

## NEVER call `get_transcript` (convo MCP) — it kills your own transport

**Operator prohibition, 2026-07-26. Binds every seat.** Do not call
`mcp__convo__get_transcript` — not with a small `limit`, not "just once", not as
a fallback when another read comes back thin.

**Why:** its `limit` argument does **not** bound the response. A `limit=4` call
returned a payload large enough to take the session's convo **stdio connection
down with it** — every `mcp__convo__*` tool disappeared mid-turn.

**The cost is not a failed read — it is losing the ability to POST.** You go
blind and mute together: no `post_response` to unblock a ring waiting on you, no
`list_decisions`, no `orientation`. And it is silent to everyone else — the
fleet keeps posting into a channel you can no longer hear, and your seat looks
merely quiet.

**The reason you used to be tempted is GONE. Use `detail: "standard"`.**

Verified 2026-08-09 against the upgraded `mootup` dependency, which added event
search/pagination and better thread ergonomics. `get_recent_context` and
`get_mentions` **now take a `detail` argument, and `detail: "standard"` returns
the full message text** — with a real `limit` and a `since_event_id` cursor:

```
get_mentions(detail="standard", limit=1)                   full body, latest mention
get_recent_context(detail="standard", limit=N)             full bodies, newest N
get_recent_context(detail="standard", since_event_id=ID)   cursor poll
```

⇒ **The old rationale — *"`get_transcript` is the only read that returns
bodies"* — is FALSE.** That was the entire pull toward it, and the moment it bit
was when you needed the full text of a **truncated notification** while
something was blocked. **That case is now served by a bounded, cursored call.**
`detail` defaults to `"minimal"`, so pass it explicitly; a thin result means you
omitted the argument, **never** that you need `get_transcript`.

The HTTP read path still works as a fallback, with **your own** credential
(never another seat's `api_key`; never dump `.moot/actors.json` to learn its
shape): `GET {API}/api/spaces/{space_id}/events?limit=N` with `Authorization:
Bearer <own key>`, `API` from `moot.toml`'s `convo.api_url`. **Prefer
`detail: "standard"` — one call, and no credential handling.**

**The `get_transcript` prohibition itself is UNCHANGED and remains absolute.**
It is the operator's to lift, not yours, and the upgrade is **not** a licence to
retry it. A working `get_transcript` in some future version is still not a
reason to try it now to find out — the failure costs you the ability to **post**,
and there is now no read it uniquely provides.

## Conventions

- **Read `docs/PRINCIPLES.md`** — the project's reasoning charter (agents-write/
  humans-read, decide on intrinsic merits not effort, small auditable TCB,
  reflect-don't-extend, subsume-don't-proliferate, honesty about the boundary).
  When the spec does not settle a choice, reason from it.
- ** LOCAL BUILDS/TESTS ARE TARGETED ONLY — NEVER `--workspace` (operator, hard
  rule).** This box has limited CPU/RAM; a full `cargo build`/`cargo test
  --workspace` OOMs or wedges it and stalls the whole fleet. Build and test
  **only through `scripts/ken-cargo`, scoped to the crate you touched** (`-p
  <crate>`, or `--test <name>` for one suite) — the affected areas, nothing more.
  **The full-workspace build, the `--locked` gate, and the conformance suite run
  in CI on GitHub — NOT on the laptop.** The scripted publisher polls those exact
  CI checks before it merges, so the whole-repo gate always runs; reproducing it
  locally is redundant and is *the* resource sink. This binds **every local
  agent — implementer, QA, leader, enclave, Steward — no exceptions.** A WP
  frame's "no-regression" / "workspace-green" acceptance criterion means
  **green in CI**, never a local `--workspace` run; author and read frame ACs
  that way. Canonical statement + rationale: **`agent/COORDINATION.md §12`**.
- **Write in plain text. No decorative icons** (operator, 2026-08-01). Do not
  open lines, headings, table cells, or emphasis with symbols like star, warning
  sign, no-entry, check mark, or any emoji. **The operator finds them
  distracting rather than helpful, and they are not a substitute for saying the
  thing.** Convey emphasis with **bold**, with sentence structure, and with
  where you put the point — not with a glyph.
  - Applies to every artifact you author: docs, WP frames, tracker nodes, commit
    messages, PR bodies, playbooks, memory lessons, and **convo posts**.
  - This is a rule about *decoration*, not about characters. Symbols that carry
    information stay: arrows in derivations (`⇒`, `→`), math and Ken notation
    (`Ω`, `≠`), and literal terminal glyphs quoted as data (a pane's `❯`
    prompt, a spinner). If removing it would lose information, it is not
    decoration.
  - **If you are copying the shape of a nearby artifact, copy the current
    rule, not the old formatting.** Much of the corpus predates this and was
    only cleaned in the instruction material; an existing WP or issue that
    still carries icons is not a licence to add more.
- **Wrap markdown at 80 columns** — target 80 *display* columns / codepoints (a
  multi-byte `—`, `→`, `Ω` is one column); lines of 81–85 are acceptable slack,
  so only reflow what exceeds **85**. Don't spend your own tokens hand-reflowing
  prose: after you finish writing or editing a Markdown file, **delegate the wrap
  to a cheap Haiku subagent** driven by the `wrap-md-80` skill. Spawn it with the
  Agent tool (`model: haiku`), telling it to read
  `agent/playbooks/tools/wrap-md-80.md` and apply it to your file(s). The skill
  is a pure whitespace-only reflow (it never changes a word, and leaves code
  fences, tables, and front matter alone); verify its output is safe with
  `git diff -w --stat` showing **no** content change. This keeps authoring on
  your model and formatting on the cheapest tier.
- **Use Mermaid for diagrams and charts** — dependency graphs, flows, state
  machines, sequence diagrams — in fenced ` ```mermaid ` blocks, **not** ASCII
  art (it renders, diffs, and edits better). Mermaid/code fences are **exempt**
  from the 80-column rule. Keep node labels plain (avoid parentheses inside
  labels; spell out symbols like `Omega` if a renderer is finicky).
- The spec is in `spec/` (`spec/SPEC-PROGRESS.md` is the status backbone); open
  design decisions are in `spec/90-open-decisions.md`; architecture decisions in
  `docs/adr/`; the clean-room policy in `CLEAN-ROOM.md`.
- Agent-team coordination law: `agent/COORDINATION.md`. Git/merge model:
  `docs/program/04-git-and-integration.md`.
