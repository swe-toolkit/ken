# Assurance and Trust

Chapter [02](02-types-contracts-and-proofs.md) closed on a deliberate gap: a
passing `ken check` establishes the proof declarations it checked, but not the
status of every guarantee the artifact discusses. Those other guarantees may
be tested, delegated, or unknown. This chapter closes that gap, and then asks
the harder question a signature and a proof together still don't answer —
what, exactly, are you trusting when you trust this file?

## Verification Status

Every specification claim in Ken carries one of four **epistemic
statuses**, visible in the source rather than collapsed into a single
pass/fail
([§5.2](../../../spec/20-verification/21-spec-syntax.md#52-the-epistemic-status-per-claim-export-facing--oq-spec-decided)):

- **`proved`** — the obligation was discharged and the kernel re-checked the
  certificate. The default for a contract that goes through, and no annotation,
  it simply holds.
- **`tested`** — a property that cannot yet be proved, asserted instead with
  a runtime/test obligation. Visible as such: a reader knows this guarantee
  rests on tests, not proof.
- **`delegated`** — a temporal/behavioral property (liveness, ordering,
  eventual consistency) that isn't a static proposition over a pure function,
  so the kernel cannot close it. Ken states it and hands it to a runtime
  sibling to model-check and monitor.
- **`unknown`** — not discharged, and no test or delegation given either: an
  admitted typed hole. The program still runs, and the result carries `unknown`
  wherever the unproven property is observed.

This four-way status is a different classification from the three-way
**verdict** (`proved`/`disproved`/`unknown`) a single obligation gets when
you attempt it
([§5.1](../../../spec/20-verification/21-spec-syntax.md#51-the-verdict-per-obligation-operational)) —
the verdict is the operational outcome of one attempt, and the epistemic status
is the label the claim carries afterward, and it is the one worth reading
for. The rest of this chapter walks all four against catalog fragments.

## Certificates and Trust

A `proved` verdict is a fact about one **claim and its certificate**, not
about a file as a whole. The
[EmptyDec fragment](../../../catalog/packages/Core/Logic/EmptyDec.ken.md)
states two such claims in its Laws & proofs section:

```ken
proof yes_is_true for decide : Equal Bool (decide (Equal Bool True True) true_is_true) True =
  Proved

proof no_is_false for decide
    : Equal Bool (decide (Equal Bool True False) true_is_not_false) False =
  Proved
```

Each is `proved`: the kernel re-checked the `Proved` certificate against
its stated `Equal Bool …` claim, and this file's whole-file elaboration —
Definition, Using it, and this Laws & proofs section together — is exactly
what `ac4_bridge_demonstrated_over_deceq_bool_not_only_deceq_int`
in the [acceptance producer](../../../crates/ken-elaborator/tests/ds1_empty_dec_acceptance.rs)
exercises when
it loads the entry standalone
([§5.3](../../../spec/20-verification/21-spec-syntax.md#53-how-the-verdict-and-the-status-relate-the-projection)).
For these two `EmptyDec` claims, the `proved` certificates add no new trust
category: each is a closed term that `check` validates, and a wrong certificate
simply fails to validate. The producer separately establishes zero
`declare_primitive`/`declare_postulate` delta for the two new inductives. That
is the grounded boundary here, and a `proved` certificate in another artifact may
still inherit primitive or postulate entries already present in its
environment.

That per-claim fact is separate from what a file's **Trust &
derivation** section reports about the assumptions the whole artifact
inherits — a different kind of accounting, not itself a verdict.
The [Transport fragment](../../../catalog/packages/Core/Logic/Transport.ken.md)
states in its Trust & derivation section:
**"`trusted_base()` delta. Zero."** That
sentence is checked by a producer,
`transport_package_adds_zero_trusted_base_delta`
in the [Transport acceptance suite](../../../crates/ken-elaborator/tests/surface_transport_acceptance.rs),
which
loads the package and asserts `trusted_base()` is set-equal before and
after — every combinator reduces through the already-trusted `J`/`cast`,
adding **nothing**.

`EmptyDec.ken.md`'s own Trust & derivation section says something
narrower, in different words: **"Zero new trust category."** That
distinction is substantive, not a paraphrase of the same fact. Its producer,
`ac3_trusted_base_delta_is_ordinary_inductive_admission_only`
(same file), establishes that `Empty`/`Dec`'s own *admission* is ordinary
inductive machinery — zero `declare_primitive`/`declare_postulate` delta
for the two new inductives themselves — which is a narrower claim than
"every claim reachable through this file is postulate-free regardless of
instance." The discussion of `unknown` below shows why the difference
matters: the same entry's own Design notes name a possible
*instantiation* whose delta is not zero, even though the entry's own §3
worked examples never build that instantiation.

The [System IO fragment](../../../catalog/packages/Capability/System/IO.ken.md)
states its boundary
directly, in its opening paragraph: its five `theorem`s are kernel-
checked proof terms, but "exactly-once settlement and liveness remain
runtime-enforced, delegated boundary properties." That sentence names, in
the fragment's own words, exactly the shape `delegated` describes in the
spec — a property about *behavior over time* (does the write eventually
settle? exactly once?), not a static proposition a pure function's body can
close, so it is stated and hands off to the runtime rather than proved here
([§5.2](../../../spec/20-verification/21-spec-syntax.md#52-the-epistemic-status-per-claim-export-facing--oq-spec-decided)).
The file marks
the line: five proofs are proved, and settlement and liveness are not, and it
says so in its own text rather than leaving a reader to assume the whole
file carries one uniform guarantee.

As with `tested` below, read that carefully: this is the fragment's own
prose naming the *concept* `delegated` describes, not an instance
of the formal, tagged `delegate` clause itself. That concrete clause
spelling is deferred exactly like `tested`'s — both are named but left
un-spelled pending the behavioral sibling and the test/generator framework
([§5.5](../../../spec/20-verification/21-spec-syntax.md#55-scope-ruling--disposition-tag-syntax-is-deferred)) —
so treat the formal `delegated` status, like `tested`, as **unavailable**
in this curriculum's checked fragments, even though the concept it names
is stated plainly in corpus prose.

The [Property fragment](../../../catalog/packages/Tooling/Testing/Property.ken.md)
draws a related but different line. Its concrete witnesses are computations,
while private checked runner laws state what successful and failing runs imply
for every finite sample list. That distinguishes exercising code from exporting
a formal `tested` status, but it is not an example of the spec's formal,
tagged `tested` epistemic status, which is produced by an `assume`/`test`-
tagged clause lowering a `requires`/`ensures` to a runtime assertion. That
concrete clause grammar is still proposal-level
([§§5.2, 5.5](../../../spec/20-verification/21-spec-syntax.md#52-the-epistemic-status-per-claim-export-facing--oq-spec-decided)),
and none of this curriculum's registered fragments exhibit it. So: read
`Property.ken.md` for the concept `tested` names, while taking the formal tagged
construct itself as **unavailable** in the fragment set.

`EmptyDec.ken.md`'s own Design notes section states a caveat about an
instantiation the entry itself never builds as a **worked example**:
`dec_eq_decides Int (DecEq Int) x y` type-checks and is usable, but
`DecEq Int.sound` is "`Axiom`-backed (`Int` is an opaque primitive, no
induction)" — its `Yes` branch's proof rides that axiom rather than a
kernel-checked derivation. An axiom admitted this way is exactly a
**postulate**: an assumed proposition entered via `declare_postulate`, one
of Ken's exactly three trusted-computing-base categories, alongside the
kernel itself and the primitive declarations
([§1](../../../spec/60-security/64-trust-model.md#1-the-trusted-computing-base-tcb-precisely)).
Nothing else is trusted — not the elaborator, not the prover, not the
surface compiler — they all produce artifacts the kernel re-checks. This is
exactly *why* the entry's actual §3 worked examples deliberately use
`DecEq Bool`
instead: an inductive carrier proved by no-confusion and
zero-delta, so the showcase itself is not quietly resting on the axiom the
Design notes names.

Chapter [01](01-anatomy.md) already showed you that every selected
fragment's Trust & derivation section states a `trusted_base()` delta. You
can read what that number certifies — and, as the earlier certificate
examples show, what
it does not: the sentence in a fragment's prose is only as trustworthy as
the producer that computed it. The kernel's `trusted_base()`
enumerates, on demand, every postulate and primitive declaration an
artifact rests on, and it is complete by construction — the only two ways an
unchecked assumption can enter the program are `declare_postulate` and
`declare_primitive`, and both land exactly the declarations the enumerator
lists, so no assumption can hide
([§1.1](../../../spec/60-security/64-trust-model.md#11-the-enumeration-contract-soundness-landed-producer),
[§1.2](../../../spec/60-security/64-trust-model.md#12-the-completeness-net-no-hidden-assumption-by-construction)).
An **empty** delta is the "fully verified, nothing assumed" signal, and a
**non-empty** one lists exactly what you inherit. Crucially, this is
decidable from the kernel's own state, not from a label a file's prose
chooses to print: a claim is `proved` **iff** its certificate checks *and*
no postulate carrying its goal sits in `trusted_base()` — so a file cannot
claim `proved` for something the kernel itself would list as assumed
([§5.4](../../../spec/20-verification/21-spec-syntax.md#54-the-honesty-guard-unknowntesteddelegated-never-read-proved)).
For Transport, the cited producer performs this check:
`trusted_base()` before loading the package equals `trusted_base()` after.
For EmptyDec, the corresponding producer instead confirms the narrower,
accurately-worded claim its own prose makes: the admission itself carries
no primitive/postulate delta, which is a different, smaller fact than
"every claim in this file is delta-free regardless of instance." Reading a
fragment's own Trust & derivation sentence is a reasonable first read, but
what makes it a *checked fact* rather than an author's promise is the
producer behind it — read the sentence, then, when the claim matters, find
and read the producer that established it.

## Stated Limits

The [filesystem errors fragment](../../../catalog/packages/Capability/Filesystem/Errors.ken.md)
states its boundary before any code: the runtime `check_fs_capability` gate
checks the required rights and authority, while downstream filesystem
resolution enforces confinement. `Full` retains all seven rights, including
write and delete, but exercises them only within its `FsScope`. That division
is the same posture the trust model itself insists on at the language level —
a verified system that over-claims is itself a security risk, so stated limits
are first-class, not buried
([§4](../../../spec/60-security/64-trust-model.md#4-the-honest-limits-what-a-language-cannot-fix-normative)).
This entry's rights, scopes, and division of enforcement are chapter
[04](04-effects-capabilities-and-authority.md)'s subject, and here, notice only
that stating a boundary is a discipline the fragments themselves practice,
not just a rule stated about them from outside.

You can now classify a claim by epistemic status and then find the producer
that supports that classification. An empty `trusted_base()` delta is a
kernel-derived inventory result, not a general promise that every possible
instantiation is assumption-free. The property runner and the IO package
illustrate testing and delegation while the corresponding tagged surface
constructs remain unavailable in these fragments.
