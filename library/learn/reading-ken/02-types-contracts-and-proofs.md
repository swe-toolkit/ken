# Types, Contracts, and Proofs

Chapter [01](01-anatomy.md) showed you where a declaration's signature sits
relative to its body and its proofs. This chapter is about what that
signature promises, how a Ken program's contract is stated
separately from its evidence, and how to read that evidence once you find
it.

## Signatures

A definition's keyword is a **checked signal**, not a comment: the keyword
is verified against both the declared signature and the body's actual,
transitively-inferred behavior, and a disagreement in either direction is a
hard error at the definition site
([§1.6.2](../../../spec/30-surface/36-effects.md#162-the-bidirectional-check--the-keyword-cannot-lie)).
Concretely: an `fn` that performs an effect is rejected, and a `proc`
whose *declared* row is empty — and which is not a `space` operation — is
flagged as a should-be-`fn`/`const` mismatch. A `proc` that declares a
non-empty row is valid even when its body happens to be
pure: declaring more than the body presently uses is legitimate stable-
interface headroom, not a violation. This is why reading a signature
first, as chapter [01](01-anatomy.md) recommends, is not just a convenient
habit: the signature is a
promise the elaborator itself enforces, not a description the author
could have gotten away with getting wrong.

That promise is about **purity and effects**. It says nothing yet about
*which value* a function returns for a given input, or *why* — that is a
separate, further contract, stated in a proof declaration next to the
function, not folded into its type.

## Proof Claims

Ken has three surface forms for stating and discharging that further
contract, all of them surface/elaboration vocabulary over already-checked
terms — none adds a new kernel declaration class or an ambient proof search
([§8](../../../spec/30-surface/33-declarations.md#8-named-proof-claims--prop-theorem-and-attached-proof)):

- **`proof <name> for <subject>`** — a checked proof attached to an
  already-resolved subject, addressed afterward as `subject::name`. It
  names "a checked property *of* `subject`" — the subject must occur
  applied somewhere in the proof's claim
  ([§8.2](../../../spec/30-surface/33-declarations.md#82-attached-proofs--proof)).
- **`theorem`** — a standalone checked proof theorem in the ordinary module
  namespace, used when no single subject owns the theorem
  ([§8.3](../../../spec/30-surface/33-declarations.md#83-standalone-theorems--theorem)).
- **`prop`** — names a proposition family / claim shape, not itself a proof
  [§8.1](../../../spec/30-surface/33-declarations.md#81-proposition-families--prop)).

You can see both of the proof forms in the fragments this curriculum draws
from. The [Transport fragment](../../../catalog/packages/Core/Logic/Transport.ken.md)
states `cong`, `sym`,
and `trans` as `theorem`s — none of them belongs to one specific subject,
they are the general equality algebra later proofs build on. The same file
also attaches a proof directly to a subject:

```ken
proof transport for stuck_of (k : Bool) (q : Equal Bool k True) : Equal Bool (stuck_of k) True =
  ...
```

Here `stuck_of` is the resolved subject, `transport` is the proof's name,
and the claim (`Equal Bool (stuck_of k) True`) genuinely mentions
`stuck_of` applied — exactly the well-formedness condition §8.2 states.

Return to `get_or_else` from the
[sums combinators](../../../catalog/packages/Data/Sums/Combinators.ken.md),
read with its proofs attached:

```ken
fn get_or_else (a : Type) (d : a) (x : Option a) : a =
  match x {
    None ↦ d;
    Some v ↦ v
  }

proof none for get_or_else (a : Type) (d : a) : Equal a (get_or_else a d (None a)) d = Refl

proof some for get_or_else (a : Type) (d : a) (v : a) : Equal a (get_or_else a d (Some a v)) v =
  Refl
```

The signature promises only "pure function, `(a : Type) → a → Option a →
a`." The
two attached proofs are the actual contract a reader wants: at `None`, the
result is exactly the default `d`, and at `Some v`, the result is exactly `v`.
Each is proved by `Refl` — the equation holds by computation alone, because
`get_or_else` is a direct structural case-split with no further machinery
in the way
([§6](../../../docs/program/07-catalog-style-guide.md#6-proof-presentation)).
A third proof in the same file, `none_rhs for or_else`, needs an actual
`match` inside its own proof body rather than closing by `Refl` alone —
because that equation's left-hand side is not yet reduced until its own
scrutinee is case-split. Reading which proof closes immediately by `Refl`
and which needs its own case split is itself informative: it tells you
whether the property was true "by definition" at the call site you are
looking at, or only after further computation.

## Checked Evidence

`ken check` on one of these files elaborates every declaration, including
every attached proof and lemma, against the kernel. A passing check
therefore does establish that every stated equation is proved. It does
not, by itself, tell you *which closing term* discharged each one, and
that closing term is itself informative. The normative rule is stated
directly, not merely illustrated by occurrence: a claim closes by `Refl`
when its two endpoints reduce to a **neutral** term — stuck, still open —
so the goal stays `Eq`-shaped, and it closes by `Proved` when both endpoints
instead reduce to the **same constructor head**, which observationally
collapses the equality itself to `Top`, a shape `Refl` (which requires a
live `Eq` goal) no longer applies to
([§3.2](../../../spec/50-stdlib/55-lawful-functors.md#32-the-proved-vs-refl-discrimination-a-load-bearing-k7-subtlety)).
`get_or_else`'s two proofs above both close with `Refl`, over the open,
still-abstract variables `a` and `d` — the two sides of each equation
reduce to the identical, but not fully closed, neutral term.
The [EmptyDec fragment](../../../catalog/packages/Core/Logic/EmptyDec.ken.md)
uses its Laws & proofs section to close a different kind of claim —
`decide`/`true_is_true`/
`true_is_not_false`, all closed, fully-applied terms — with `Proved`
instead, exactly because both sides there reduce all the way to the same
concrete `Bool` constructor. Reading which closing term a proof
uses, and whether the terms it relates are still open or already fully
closed, tells you something `ken check`'s bare exit code does not: this
is the discipline chapter 03 builds on directly. A checked proof tells
you its stated equation was proved, and it does not classify every other
guarantee the file discusses, which may be tested, delegated, or unknown.

You can now distinguish the effect promise in a signature from the
equational claims beside it. You can also tell whether a claim belongs to a
subject, stands alone as a lemma, or merely names a proposition family. The
closing term then shows whether equality remained `Eq`-shaped for `Refl` or
reduced to `Top` for `Proved`.
