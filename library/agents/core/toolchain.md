# Toolchain

## 1. Use when

Use this module to choose a current Ken command and interpret its artifact or
failure. Do not use it to infer that one execution path validates another.

## 2. Prerequisites

Know whether the input is plain `.ken`, literate `.ken.md`, a pure library, or a
runnable program. Load `read-ken.md` if that role is unclear.

## 3. Current capability

The current CLI exposes:

| Command | Current role |
|---|---|
| `ken check <file>` | elaborate and verify a source file and its checked fences without driving I/O |
| `ken run <file> [-- args...]` | elaborate and run a `proc main` through the reference path |
| `ken native-build <file> <output-dir>` | build a checked entrypoint as a native artifact |
| `ken fmt [--check] <paths...>` | write or verify canonical formatting |
| `ken repl` | interactive evaluation |
| `ken version` | version and kernel information |

## 4. Canonical forms

```text
ken check catalog/packages/Core/Logic/Transport.ken.md
ken fmt --check path/to/source.ken
ken run path/to/program.ken -- first-argument
ken native-build path/to/program.ken build/native-output
```

Use the command matching the file's role, and do not treat a deliberately
non-runnable library as a failed program.

## 5. Invariants and prohibitions

- `check` does not execute I/O or establish native parity.
- `run` requires exactly one valid entrypoint and the capabilities it uses.
- `native-build` success does not by itself establish parity with the
  interpreter.
- `fmt --check` validates layout, not semantics or readability.
- A `ken reject` fence must reject and a `ken example` fence must elaborate.

## 6. Decision procedure

1. Classify the artifact and required observation.
2. Choose the narrowest matching command.
3. Preserve stdout, stderr, exit status, and named output artifacts.
4. If the observation crosses from checking to execution or native code, run
   the additional path explicitly.
5. Stop if the command is absent from `ken help` or the required capability is
   unavailable.

## 7. Failure signatures

| Signature | Likely layer | Next inspection |
|---|---|---|
| unknown subcommand | CLI surface | `ken help` |
| parse/elaboration error | source front end | source span and expected type |
| pure library has no `main` entrypoint | wrong command/file role | use `ken check` or add a real entrypoint |
| missing capability | entrypoint authority | program capability manifest |
| native build failure after check succeeds | backend/toolchain | native diagnostic and parity test |

## 8. Validation

Capture the exact command and exit status. For documentation fences, run `ken
check` on the containing Markdown file. For execution claims, record observable
output. For native claims, compare closure-free ground observations with the
reference interpreter on the same checked input. Observe a callable-bearing
result only through selected, well-typed projections or applications, and never
compare closure identity or representation.

## 9. Authority and sources

If asserting that a Ken CLI command or spelling is implemented, or prescribing
that command as available, load `crates/ken-cli/src/main.rs` or cite an exact
observed command artifact first. If asserting what `check`, reference
execution, or a host-driven run establishes, load
`spec/40-runtime/42-evaluation.md` first. If asserting native ABI behavior,
executable portability, or an every-target limit, load
`spec/40-runtime/48-executable-artifact-contract.md` first. Native backend
posture is in `spec/40-runtime/45-native-backend.md`. The verified revision is
in `library/agents/manifest.toml`.

## 10. Known unavailable or partial behavior

One successful command does not establish properties of commands not run.
Single-file `ken check` is not a roots-based cross-file loader test, and a
native artifact is not automatically evidence of interpreter parity. If a
requested command or host capability is not listed by `ken help`, stop and
report it unavailable rather than inventing a flag or fallback.
