# Proof techniques — how to actually discharge a law in Ken

Ken's laws are ordinary `Ω`-propositions and its proofs are ordinary terms
(`spec/10-kernel/16-observational.md`) — there is no separate tactic
language, `sorry`, or postponed goal. This strand is the practice of closing
those goals: choosing the right terminal move, structuring a case-split so a
hypothesis stays usable, decidable equality via `sound`/`complete`, why
`funext` needs no lemma, and the non-termination hazards a proof author
needs to see coming before the kernel rejects the definition outright.

Every example below is checked against the real elaborator; every reject
example is checked to actually fail, with the real error message quoted so a
reader recognizes it when they hit it themselves.

## 1. `Proved` vs. `Refl`: the two-way discriminator

A proof's terminal step at an equation goal is **`Proved` or `Refl` depending on
what the two endpoints reduce to — never a uniform choice**. Ken's
observational equality collapses two occurrences of the **same nullary
constructor** to `Top` (`spec/10-kernel/16-observational.md`, the K7 rule):
once that collapse fires, the goal is `Top`-shaped, not `Eq`-shaped, and
`Refl` — which only checks against an `Eq`-shaped goal — no longer applies.
A **neutral** (stuck) endpoint never collapses and stays `Eq`-shaped — but
`Refl` needs more than "stuck": it needs the goal's two sides to be
**convertible**, which is guaranteed when they are the *same* term (the
trivial case below), not merely when both happen to be stuck. §1.1 below
covers the case where neither applies.

`bool_and True True` reduces to `True`, so `Equal Bool (bool_and True True)
True` collapses all the way to `Top`:

```ken example
theorem with_tt : Equal Bool (bool_and True True) True = Proved
```

This fails with `"Refl expects an `Eq`-shaped goal"` — the goal already
collapsed to `Top` before `Refl` was checked against it:

```ken reject
theorem with_refl : Equal Bool (bool_and True True) True = Refl
```

An abstract (neutral) variable never collapses, so the same shape flips:

```ken example
theorem self_eq_refl (x : Bool) : Equal Bool (bool_and x x) (bool_and x x) = Refl
```

This fails: the goal never reduced to `Top` (`x` is abstract), so there is
nothing for `Proved` (a `Top` introduction) to close:

```ken reject
theorem self_eq_tt (x : Bool) : Equal Bool (bool_and x x) (bool_and x x) = Proved
```

### 1.1 When neither closes: opaque primitives don't reduce under conversion

`self_eq_refl` above works because its goal's two sides are the **identical**
term (`bool_and x x` on both sides) — trivially convertible, no reduction
needed. A goal whose two sides are only *equal at runtime*, not the same
term, needs one of them to actually **reduce** to the other during
conversion — and a `declare_primitive` operation (`eq_int`, `and_bool`,
`leq_int`, …) **never unfolds under conversion, even applied to concrete
values**: the interpreter reduces it at runtime, but the kernel's
convertibility check does not. A goal built from one is **permanently
stuck**, whatever the arguments:

```ken
const five : Int = 5
```

This fails with `"Refl: the two sides of the goal are not convertible"` —
`eq_int five five` never reduces to `True` under conversion, even though
`five` is concrete and the two arguments are literally the same value:

```ken reject
theorem prim_eq_refl : Equal Bool (eq_int five five) True = Refl
```

This fails too, for the same reason: the goal never reduced to `Top` either:

```ken reject
theorem prim_eq_tt : Equal Bool (eq_int five five) True = Proved
```

The honest closer is a VISIBLE postulate, the same audited-delta shape
`Int`'s own Eq/Ord instances use (§3) — the proposition is true, just not
kernel-reducible at this layer:

```ken example
axiom prim_eq_axiom : Equal Bool (eq_int five five) True
```

This is not a corner case to memorize and forget: **any law whose operation
bottoms out in a primitive, applied to values that are not already literal
constants in the goal itself, needs this same honest `Axiom` treatment** —
`Proved`/`Refl` are not a fallback pair that always covers a stuck goal.

**The check, in order:** reduce both endpoints. Same nullary constructor (or
a non-nullary constructor whose every component also collapses) → `Top` →
`Proved`. The identical term on both sides (or otherwise genuinely convertible,
e.g. via a **transparent** `fn`'s own ι-reduction) → `Refl`. Stuck on an
**opaque primitive** with no further reduction available on either side →
neither closes — the honest move is a visible `Axiom` (§1.1). Never assume a
base case defaults to one of the three from its shape alone — check the
reduced endpoints and what kind of operation they're stuck on, every time.

## 2. Induction and motive construction

Ken has no separate induction tactic: an inductive proof is an ordinary
**structurally recursive `fn`**, SCT-checked exactly like any other
recursive definition (§5). The base case typically closes with `Proved`
(constructor endpoints collapse); the step case typically needs `cong` to
lift the induction hypothesis under the outer constructor, because the two
sides of the step's goal are **neutral** (an abstract tail `t` never
reduces further) and so never collapse on their own. Below is the right unit
for `list_append`: the base case has both sides reduce to the constructor
`Nil a` → `Proved`; the step case's goal is `Cons x (list_append t Nil)` vs.
`Cons x t` — neutral in the abstract tail `t`, so the recursive call's
result (the induction hypothesis) is lifted under `Cons x` by `cong`:

```ken example
theorem list_right_unit
      (a : Type) (xs : List a)
    : Equal (List a) (list_append a xs (Nil a)) xs =
  match xs {
    Nil ↦ Proved;
    Cons x t ↦
      cong (List a) (List a) (list_append a t (Nil a)) t (λl. Cons a x l) (list_right_unit a t)
  }
```

**Bind each case-split variable as its own function, before the hypothesis
that depends on it.** A law with more than one case-split parameter and a
hypothesis about both (`(x:a)(y:a)(p:P x y) → Concl`) is tempting to bind
flat — but `match x { … }` only narrows the **goal**, never a **sibling**
binder's already-fixed type, so `p` stays symbolic in `x`/`y` inside every
branch and can't be reused where a branch needs it concretely. Instead,
case-split each variable through its **own** `match`-returning-a-function
layer, and only introduce the hypothesis's `λ` *after* every relevant
variable is already concrete — exactly the shape `bool_eq_sound`/
`bool_eq_complete` use in §3, and the shape every law field in
`catalog/packages/Core/Classes/LawfulClasses.ken` follows. Once the
hypothesis's binder-time type is concrete, a branch whose hypothesis is
*already* the goal (e.g. an "impossible" combination where the hypothesis
and the goal are the same false equation) can reuse it directly — no
`absurd` detour needed in that case, and `absurd` is exactly what closes the
branches where the hypothesis genuinely is impossible (§3).

## 3. Decidable equality: the `sound`/`complete` pattern

`spec/50-stdlib/51-lawful-classes.md`'s `DecEq a` class states two directions
for a `Bool`-valued `eq`: `sound` (`eq x y = True` implies the real,
propositional `Equal a x y`) and `complete` (the reverse). Both directions
follow the §2 case-split-then-lambda shape, closing each of the four
constructor combinations with `Proved` (matching endpoints) or `absurd`
(mismatched endpoints — the hypothesis, once concrete, is a false equation
between different nullary constructors, which collapses to `Bottom`, K5):

```ken example
theorem bool_eq_sound (x : Bool) : (y : Bool) → IsTrue (bool_eq x y) → Equal Bool x y =
  match x {
    True ↦
      λy.
        match y {
          True ↦ λh. Proved;
          False ↦ λh. absurd h
        };
    False ↦
      λy.
        match y {
          True ↦ λh. absurd h;
          False ↦ λh. Proved
        }
  }

theorem bool_eq_complete (x : Bool) : (y : Bool) → Equal Bool x y → IsTrue (bool_eq x y) =
  match x {
    True ↦
      λy.
        match y {
          True ↦ λp. Proved;
          False ↦ λp. absurd p
        };
    False ↦
      λy.
        match y {
          True ↦ λp. absurd p;
          False ↦ λp. Proved
        }
  }
```

An **audited-delta** carrier (a K1 primitive like `Int`, opaque to δ, with
no induction principle) cannot follow this pattern — its `sound`/`complete`
are not kernel-provable at all, and the honest spelling is the visible
`Axiom` postulate (`catalog/packages/Core/Classes/LawfulClasses.ken`'s
`Int` instance), never a proof that only looks real.

## 4. `funext` is definitional

Ken's equality at a function type **reduces to the pointwise family**:
`Equal ((x:A)→B) f g` is, definitionally, `(x:A) → Equal B (f x) (g x)`
(`spec/10-kernel/16-observational.md §2.2`, the observational-equality
computation rule for `Π`). Function extensionality therefore needs **no
axiom and no lemma** — a bare pointwise proof checks directly against a
function-equality goal, because the goal *is* that pointwise type after one
reduction step. `not_bool` and `flip_bool` below are two syntactically
different functions; proving them equal AS FUNCTIONS needs no `funext`
call, only a pointwise proof, because `Equal (Bool -> Bool) f g`
whnf-reduces to exactly that pointwise Pi type:

```ken example
theorem not_functions_equal : Equal (Bool → Bool) not_bool flip_bool =
  λb.
    match b {
      True ↦ Proved;
      False ↦ Proved
    }
```

**Do not proliferate a second, function-level law field when a class's
canonical law is more natural stated pointwise** (e.g. a `Functor`'s
`map_id`): the point-free and pointwise statements are the same
proposition up to this one reduction, so pick whichever reads better at the
call site and treat the other as free.

## 5. Non-termination hazards

Every transparent (δ-unfoldable) recursive definition is admitted only if
it passes the kernel's **size-change termination (SCT)** gate at definition
time (`spec/10-kernel/17-conversion.md §4`) — this is the *sole*
termination guarantee; there is no fuel or cycle guard on δ-unfolding
itself, so a definition that slips past SCT does not merely run slowly, it
makes conversion (and therefore type-checking) **loop**. `list_right_unit`
above passes because its recursive call is on the strictly smaller tail
`t`. A self-reference with no strictly-decreasing argument is rejected,
whatever form it takes — a bare, unapplied self-reference is the minimal
case:

This fails with `"SCT: idempotent self-loop has no strictly-decreasing
parameter"`:

```ken reject
theorem bad : Bottom = bad
```

**Every occurrence of a recursive definition inside its own body counts**,
not only occurrences applied to arguments (`spec/10-kernel/17-conversion.md
§4.1`'s call-graph-completeness invariant) — an unapplied self-reference
passed to another function is exactly as rejected as the direct form above,
so there is no laundering route through a combinator. When a genuinely
well-founded recursion doesn't obviously decrease on a single structural
argument, restructure it around an explicit accumulator or a decreasing
index rather than reaching for a workaround — the gate's job is to reject
exactly the definitions that would make the kernel unsound if admitted.

## 6. Name endpoints and evidence in proof chains

A multi-step proof is easiest to audit when its middle endpoints have domain
names and a non-obvious transported fact has a name that states its role. Keep
the final combinator skeleton visible: local bindings should expose the
`trans`/`cong`/`J` structure, not replace it with an opaque helper.

When a proof needs at least two sequential local bindings, write one binding
group and separate the bindings with `;`, with no trailing separator before
`in`. A binding can use earlier names but not itself or later names, and a
duplicate name in the same group is rejected. The formatter coalesces a maximal
directly nested chain of at least two lets into this group form; a one-binding
`let` remains the same one-binding production
(`spec/30-surface/32-grammar.md:200-221`,
`spec/30-surface/31-lexical.md:228-231`).

The String certificate is a compact example. `left_chars` and `right_chars`
name the representation-level endpoints; `left_round_trip` and
`right_round_trip` name the String endpoints; the two evidence bindings say
which bridge each proof crosses. Their binding group follows the proof's
dependency order, so each later right-hand side can use the earlier aliases.
The local aliases are definitionally equal to the original expressions, so
`same_chars` is accepted directly by `cong`; no transport lemma is needed.

```ken example
axiom string_to_list_char_retraction
    : (text : String) → Equal String (list_char_to_string (string_to_list_char text)) text

theorem string_to_list_char_injective_with_lets
      (left : String)
      (right : String)
      (same_chars : Equal (List Char) (string_to_list_char left) (string_to_list_char right))
    : Equal String left right =
  let
    left_chars : List Char = string_to_list_char left;
    right_chars : List Char = string_to_list_char right;
    left_round_trip : String = list_char_to_string left_chars;
    right_round_trip : String = list_char_to_string right_chars;
    left_retracts : Equal String left left_round_trip =
      sym String left_round_trip left (string_to_list_char_retraction left);
    mapped_chars : Equal String left_round_trip right_round_trip =
      cong (List Char) String left_chars right_chars list_char_to_string same_chars
  in
    trans
      String
      left
      left_round_trip
      right
      left_retracts
      (trans
        String
        left_round_trip
        right_round_trip
        right
        mapped_chars
        (string_to_list_char_retraction right))
```

A reduced Map bridge has the same shape. The operation-specific proof supplies
the three endpoints and two facts; the bridge names the facts by their roles and
leaves the final `trans` visible. Its two-binding group makes the dependency
order explicit before `in`. In a real Map proof, names such as `inserted`,
`selected_branch`, and `ordered_result` are more useful than `step1`, `tmp`,
and `value2` because they tell the reader what changed.

```ken example
data GuideMap k v = GuideLeaf | GuideNode k v

theorem guide_map_insert_bridge
      (k : Type)
      (v : Type)
      (inserted : GuideMap k v)
      (selected_branch : GuideMap k v)
      (ordered_result : GuideMap k v)
      (branch_evidence : Equal (GuideMap k v) inserted selected_branch)
      (ordering_evidence : Equal (GuideMap k v) selected_branch ordered_result)
    : Equal (GuideMap k v) inserted ordered_result =
  let
    selected_by_comparison : Equal (GuideMap k v) inserted selected_branch = branch_evidence;
    branch_preserves_order : Equal (GuideMap k v) selected_branch ordered_result =
      ordering_evidence
  in
    trans
      (GuideMap k v)
      inserted
      selected_branch
      ordered_result
      selected_by_comparison
      branch_preserves_order
```

Expression length is evidence, never the decision. A one-step `cong` whose
endpoints are already obvious is clearer inline, as are small exhaustive
matches and direct structural recursion. Bind only when the name states a proof
endpoint, evidence role, invariant, or stage the reader would otherwise have to
reconstruct. There is no binding quota, depth threshold, or minimum count. When
an intermediate is reusable or recursive, promote it to a
top-level `theorem` instead; when many unrelated bindings accumulate, split the
proof rather than creating a local namespace.

## 7. Proof completion and acceptance

A package law is complete when its proof is complete. The proof is an
intrinsic part of the package: the kernel re-checks the ordinary term against
its `Omega`-proposition, so a reader can verify the stated guarantee by
checking the package. A test remains useful evidence about a computation, but
it is external to that guarantee: accepting it requires trust that both the
package and the test were implemented correctly. It is therefore strictly
inferior to a kernel-checked proof for a law that can be proved.

Treat proof completion as the acceptance condition, not as a quality pass to
schedule after a test is green. If a proof is genuinely deferred, record an
explicit follow-on that owns completion rather than letting the test stand in
for it. A visible `Axiom` remains an audited trust delta (§3), not a completed
proof. This follows the project's [proof-completeness principle](../../../docs/PRINCIPLES.md#16-a-package-is-finished-only-when-proven--tests-are-not-part-of-it).

## Design notes

- **Why no `sorry`/postponed goals exist**: every hole in a Ken proof is
  either a real term or the honest, visible `Axiom` postulate (§3) — never
  a silent gap. A law field that "will be proved later" is not merged with
  a placeholder; it is either proved now or the catalog entry's Trust
  section discloses the delta.
- **Why the restructuring discipline in §2 matters more than it looks**: it
  is the difference between a law that is provable *today* and one that
  looks stateable but silently can't close in any branch that needs a
  sibling hypothesis concretely.

## Findings

- The conformance fixture
  (`conformance/challenge/C1-deceq-noncanonical/unsound-deceq-decimal.ken`)
  writes `Refl Bool True` — the **applied** form, which fails with
  `UnresolvedCon` (`Refl` is checked-only, matching solely a bare
  `RCon("Refl")`, `crates/ken-elaborator/src/elab.rs`). Replacing it with bare
  `Refl` is not sufficient: bare `Refl` also fails there (`"the two sides of
  the goal are not convertible"`), as does `Proved`, because `decimalEq`
  bottoms out in the opaque primitives `eq_int`/`and_bool`, which never
  reduce under conversion (§1.1). The honest witness is `Axiom`.
