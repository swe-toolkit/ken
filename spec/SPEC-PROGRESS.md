# Ken specification — chapter status index

This file is the human-readable reconciliation index for the Ken
specification. It records what each chapter says about its own provenance or
delivery stage and how strongly that chapter says its text binds. Sequencing
readers use those declarations and their stated scope; this index does not
invent a separate maturity judgment.

The chapters remain authoritative for their own declarations. This index is a
measured view of all 63 Markdown files under `spec/` at the reconciliation
point. It is not a build tracker, a next-action queue, or a substitute for the
work-package nodes under `docs/program/issues/`.

## Status convention

This index adopts **shape B: provenance/stage plus binding force**. The former
`TODO · DRAFT · REVISED · DONE` ladder is retired because no rule derives
drafting maturity from declarations such as `K1 elaborated`, `impl-ready (L2)`,
or scope-qualified `Normative`. In particular, an `elaborated` work-package
marker says who or what elaborated a chapter; it does not prove that the
chapter passed through a hidden `REVISED` rung.

Shape A would require that unsupported maturity mapping. Shape C would call
this table derived without supplying a derivation mechanism, and a
declaration-only derivation would omit the three status-less files. Shape B
instead keeps one explicit, total inventory while using only quantities the
chapter declarations actually state.

Apply the convention as follows:

1. Read the declaration's complete opening status sentence, not its first
   Markdown-emphasized span. Record every clause in that sentence that
   predicates a provenance or delivery stage of the chapter or one of its
   named sections. Stage predicates are `DRAFT vN`, `elaborated`, a WP that
   `extends` or `completes` a fragment, `impl-ready` or
   `implementation-ready`, `contract-pinned`, `implementation-gated`,
   `CAPSTONE COMPLETE`, and an explicitly numbered audit phase. Preserve
   adjacent qualifiers that identify the WP, section, series, or delivery
   scope. Normalize multiple clauses into reading order with semicolons; do
   not translate one predicate into another.
2. Read binding force from the same declaration. Statements that text is
   normative, fixes or pins a contract, records a settled rule, or defines an
   operative boundary bind at the scope they name. Proposal-level, starter,
   `(oracle)`-tagged, deferred, and implementation-gated portions remain
   qualified exactly as the declaration says.
3. A `DRAFT` marker does not weaken an explicitly normative contract, and an
   `impl-ready` or `elaborated` marker does not strengthen a proposal-level
   spelling.
4. `Normative`, proposal-level, and operator-facing role statements belong to
   the binding-force axis, not the provenance/stage axis. If a declaration
   supplies force but no stage predicate, record `not declared` for the first
   axis. If a file has no `> Status:` declaration, assign neither axis by
   inference and record it in the unclassifiable report.

This convention has no unreachable rung: it preserves declarations that
chapters actually use and states their force independently. It adds no checker
or generated-status mechanism.

## Per-file inventory

The middle column applies the semantic provenance/stage rule to each file's
own `> Status:` declaration. The final column applies the binding-force rule
to that same declaration, including its qualifications.

| File | Declared provenance/delivery stage | D1 binding-force assignment |
|---|---|---|
| `00-overview.md` | `DRAFT v0` | Normative for terminology and scope; subject chapters prevail on disagreement. |

| `10-kernel/14-inductive.md` | `K1 elaborated; K1.5 extends it; nested-positive partially landed` | Normative for inductives, positivity, and elimination; fresh/composed admission and both selector sorts execute, while individually marked generated-family/method/topology/sort residuals remain under `KERNEL-NESTED-IND`. |
| `10-kernel/15-identity.md` | `K2 elaborated` | Normative for the observational-equality interface. |

| `30-surface/39-elaboration.md` | `DRAFT v0; §5 (V0) elaborated to implementation rigor for the G1 minimal slice` | Normative for elaboration output and guarantees; §5 is V0 implementation-rigorous and the other named sections remain frame-level. |

## Unclassifiable report

Exactly three inputs lack a `> Status:` declaration and therefore receive no
inferred axis value:

- `README.md` — the spec index declares neither provenance/stage nor binding
  force.
- `SPEC-PROGRESS.md` — this reconciliation index is not a self-declaring
  chapter.
- `_notes/analysis-digest.md` — the background design note declares no status.

The other 60 inputs are classifiable by the operative rule. This report does
not repair or add chapter declarations; those declarations are inputs to this
reconciliation.

## Reconciliation controls

- **Different declaration shapes:** `10-kernel/18-judgments.md` records both
  `K-api elaborated` and its suffix qualifier `implementation-ready`, then
  binds the kernel API contract; `30-surface/34-data-match.md` records
  `impl-ready (L2)` and binds its feature; `60-security/65-policy.md` has a
  force-only `Normative` declaration, so its first axis is `not declared`
  while its policy shape, guarantee, and semantics bind and syntax stays
  deferred. Each result follows the same two-axis rule.
- **Selection controls:** `10-kernel/16-observational.md` retains the K5 clause
  outside its first bold span; `30-surface/39-elaboration.md` retains its
  section-specific V0 clause; `50-stdlib/57-collections-and-views.md` retains
  the adjacent `(CAT-3)` qualifier. Markdown emphasis selects none of them.
- **Changed and retained rows:** `10-kernel/11-syntax.md` previously read
  `DRAFT` in this index; its chapter declaration yields `K1 elaborated` plus
  normative grammar/scoping. `00-overview.md` previously read `DRAFT`; its
  declaration retains the `DRAFT v0` marker while exposing its normative
  terminology/scope. Neither result is copied from the old row.
- **No `REVISED` inheritance:** the retired ladder and its unused `REVISED`
  rung do not appear in the operative vocabulary.
- **No gate:** this reconciliation changes one Markdown artifact. It adds no
  CI configuration, script, test, or documentation-content oracle.
