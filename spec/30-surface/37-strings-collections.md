## 1. The decision: state collections inductively, do not coinduct

Ken's collections core is **inductive and total**. `List` is an ordinary
inductive `data` (`34 §1`); `Array`/`Map`/`Set` are abstract types; every
operation is a **terminating** function and every
law is an ordinary **proposition**. There is **no coinductive type, no `codata`,
and no productivity/guardedness checker** (`OQ-coinduction` DECIDED — deferred;
the dual of SCT and the declined `OQ-temporal` modal growth, `§7`).

This is the same reflect-don't-extend move the kernel makes elsewhere: "defer
coinduction" does **not** mean "cannot stream." Genuine infinitude is served by
**inductive idioms** — a fuel-bounded unfold, an opt-in `Lazy` thunk, an
effectful generator, or the behavioral seam — none of which add a coinductive
value or a new kernel rule (`§5`). The decision is **durable**, not a v1
expedient: a `Stream`/`Iterator` is a *library type over these idioms*, never a
language primitive.

## 2. Strings and text

`String` is an immutable **UTF-8** text value and a **primitive type** (an
opaque type constant, `../10-kernel/14 §5`). It has deterministic durable
canonical bytes (`41 §3a`) and extensional NFC-aware equality; its in-process
storage is private. It is **not** `List Char` — that is a separate, convertible
*view* (`§2.3`).

### 2.1 NFC normalization is canonical, not representation-dependent

A `String`'s durable bytes are the **canonical bytes of its NFC-normalized
UTF-8** (`41 §3a`). Two consequences are normative and load-bearing:

- **Equality is NFC-aware.** Two strings canonically equivalent under NFC
  compare equal regardless of whether a runtime copies, shares, or interns
  them. A runtime advertising `constant-time-equality` may optimize comparison
  under `41 §4`; the result does not depend on that profile.
- **`byte_length` is over the normalized bytes.** Length-in-bytes
  reports the NFC byte buffer's length, not the pre-normalization source. This
  is the only length a program can observe, and it is deterministic.

### 2.2 Byte-length and char-length are distinct (the UTF-8 trap)

The API **distinguishes** two lengths, and they differ on any string with a
multi-byte code point:

- **`byte_length s`** — the number of bytes in the stored UTF-8 buffer.
- **`char_length s`** — the number of **Unicode scalar values** (code points);
  equal to the length of the `List Char` view (`§2.3`).

For an ASCII string the two coincide; for `"é"` (one code point, NFC `U+00E9`,
two UTF-8 bytes) `byte_length = 2` while `char_length = 1`. Indexing is **by code
point** or by an **explicit byte view** — never an ambiguous "length"/"index"
that silently means one or the other. This is the headline correctness property
of treating `String` as packed UTF-8 rather than `List Char` (AC1).

### 2.3 Convertible views — `String ↔ List Char`, `String ↔ Bytes`

`String` is *not* `List Char`, but the two are inter-convertible; likewise
`String` and `Bytes` (`38`). The conversions and their **totality** are pinned;
the literal method names are `(oracle)`-tagged (`§8`):

| Conversion | Totality | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `String → List Char` | total | decode code points (the `char_length`-long view) |
| `List Char → String` | total | encode UTF-8, then NFC-normalize |
| `String → Bytes` | total | the stored NFC UTF-8 buffer (`byte_length`-long) |
| `Bytes → String` | **partial → `Result`** | validate UTF-8, then NFC-normalize |

`Bytes → String` is the one partial direction: arbitrary bytes need not be valid
UTF-8, so it returns `Result DecodeError String` (`§6` uses `Result`, not a
sentinel). `Char` is a Unicode scalar value (`35 §2.4`: `u32`, range
`U+0000–U+10FFFF` excluding the surrogate block `U+D800–U+DFFF` — a refinement
on the carrier, so `List Char → String` cannot encode an invalid scalar).

### 2.4 No new kernel rule — small primitive core, derived surface

`String` attaches as a kernel **primitive** (`14 §5`): an opaque type constant
whose inhabitants are **string literals** and the results of a **small,
audited** set of registered primitive ops. That primitive core is deliberately
minimal — the type constant, literals, the native `String ↔ List Char`
round-trip (`string_to_list_char` / `list_char_to_string`, landed in slice 1
`L3-strings-roundtrip`, `§2.3`), and the two length reads (`byte_length` over
the packed NFC buffer and `char_length` over its Unicode scalar values).

Registration does **not** currently give those operations a kernel conversion
rule. Each is recorded as `PrimReduction::Op`, which is opaque to the landed
conversion checker: weak-head reduction unfolds transparent definitions and
performs β/ι reduction, but does not evaluate an `Op`. The interpreter evaluates
the operations at runtime, so `byte_length "abc"` produces `3` as a value; the
kernel nevertheless does **not** judge `byte_length "abc" ≡ 3`
definitionally, and `Refl` cannot discharge that equation. This differs from a
registered `PrimReduction::Literal`: the literal is a value, while applying an
`Op` is the missing reduction step.

Kernel conversion for registered operations is a **K3-deferred gap**, not a
landed facility. Adding it would require a separate kernel-TCB decision about
which computations conversion may trust. Until that decision lands, a proof
by normalization cannot depend on the result of a primitive string operation:
the direct literal equation needs the landed explicit, audited
postulate/`Axiom` posture rather than an implied computation-by-`Refl`. A future
independently checked certificate would be a separate design, not something
registration provides today. Runtime evaluation remains fully specified; only
its promotion into kernel definitional equality is deferred.

**The string *surface* — `concat` / `slice` / `char_at` / `eq` / the ordering op
— is `derived`, not primitive (`§2.5`).** These lower to ordinary prelude
`view`s over the `List Char` view (`§2.3`), routed through the native round-trip
— **not** registered native primitives. This is the settled slice-2 approach
(Approach A, Architect ruling `evt_4k1yqah3yvpds`): deriving
trivially-structural ops adds **zero** `trusted_base()` delta, where a native
prim would grow the audited reduction surface for no benefit
(subsume-don't-proliferate). So the
primitive set stays small and audited (`18 §5`), and `String` adds **no**
inductive declaration and **no** conversion rule.

String laws such as `byte_length (s ++ t) ≡ byte_length s + byte_length t` are
**prelude propositions** (`14 §5`, `35 §6.2`), not kernel reductions. Merely
stating the proposition does not make it proof-by-computation: while its
primitive operations remain conversion-opaque, the current postulate/`Axiom`
bridge is visible in `trusted_base()` rather than laundered as a `Refl` proof.

### 2.5 The derived string surface (`concat` / `slice` / `char_at` / `eq` / …)

The everyday string operations are **derived** — ordinary prelude `view`s over
the `List Char` view (`§2.3`), routed through the native `string_to_list_char`
(`s2l`) / `list_char_to_string` (`l2s`) round-trip (slice 1, landed). They add
**zero** native primitives and **zero** `trusted_base()` delta; each is a
transparent checked definition that unfolds to the `§4.1` `List Char`
combinator floor over the real `elim_List` / `elim_Nat` (`34 §3`). Kernel
conversion may unfold these checked wrappers, but
then stops at the conversion-opaque `s2l`/`l2s` primitive operations (§2.4);
the interpreter evaluates the complete operation at runtime. Thus the derived
definitions add no trust, while equations over concrete `String` values do not
become `Refl` proofs. The mandated bodies (Approach A,
`evt_4k1yqah3yvpds` — do **not** native-ize):

```
concat a b   =  l2s (list_append (s2l a) (s2l b))
slice  i j s =  l2s (take (nat_sub j i) (drop i (s2l s)))
char_at i s   =  nth i (s2l s)                        -- : Option Char
eq     a b   =  list_eq eqChar (s2l a) (s2l b)       -- : Bool
```

The equations in this subsection specify runtime/value behavior. They are not
claims that an application containing `s2l`, `l2s`, `eqChar`, or another
primitive `Op` normalizes under kernel conversion (§2.4).

- **`char_at` is total and honest about absence.** `nth` returns `None` on an
  out-of-range index and on the empty string — `char_at i "" ≡ None` and
  `char_at 5 "abc" ≡ None` — so the result type is `Option Char`, never a partial
  index (`34 §1` honest sum, not a sentinel).
- **`slice` clamps by construction.** `drop i` past the end yields `Nil` and
  `take n` past the end stops at the end, so an out-of-range `slice` returns the
  available sub-view, never stuck. The length is `nat_sub j i` — **saturating**
  `Nat` monus (`§4.1`): when `j < i` it is `0`, so `take 0 _ ≡ Nil` and
  `slice j i s ≡ ""` (an empty slice, never an underflow). Indices are
  **code-point** positions (over the `List Char` view), never byte offsets — a
  byte-offset slice could split a multi-byte scalar (`§2.2`, ADR 0010).
- **`eq` is codepoint-wise and rides the landed `eqChar`.** `eq a b` decides
  equality of the two scalar sequences via `list_eq` threading the landed
  `eqChar : Char → Char → Bool` (`= eq_int` under `Char`'s `Int` erasure,
  `decimal_char.rs`). This is the **normative default** (ADR 0010 §2):
  `l2s (s2l s) ≡ s` is the landed String-side retraction, so `s2l` is
  injective and `String` is **canonical** w.r.t. `List Char`; therefore
  codepoint-wise `eq` is sound. **NFC-normalization equality is OUT** (`§6`,
  ADR 0010 §3): it identifies distinct scalar sequences, so over the codepoint
  carrier it is *non-canonical* — a lawful `DecEq` for it would inhabit
  `Bottom`; if ever wanted it is a separately-named `Eq`/setoid in a later WP,
  **never** a `DecEq`/`Ord` here.
- **`compare` is 3-way, codepoint-wise (`§2.5.1`).** `compare a b : OrdResult`
  (`Lt` / `Eq` / `Gt`) is the lexicographic order of the two scalar sequences
  via `list_compare` threading `compare_char`. The landed `Ord Char` is
  `leq`-only (no `compare` method, no `Ordering`/`OrdResult` type on `main`), so
  `compare_char` **repackages** the landed `leqChar`/`eqChar` into 3-way and
  `OrdResult` is a locally-declared, string-surface-**exported** checked
  inductive — zero-TCB-delta (Architect ruling `evt_1stp9sspm6ag8`).

**Deliverability honesty (trust level).** This WP delivers the value-level
*functions* `eq : String → String → Bool` (and the `§2.5.1` ordering op) —
Boolean/decision operations in the tested-not-trusted interpreter ring ("a
wrong value, never a false proof"). Because `String` is **canonical** w.r.t.
`List Char` (ADR 0010 §2), these are *soundly transportable* to lawful `DecEq
String` / `Ord String` **instances** — the canonicity precondition holds here,
unlike `Decimal` (`../10-kernel/18a §5.6.1(4)`). But that transport
additionally needs a lawful **`DecEq Char`**, which is **not yet landed** (only
the `eqChar` *view* +
`Ord Char`-by-transport are on `main`); so the proof-carrying `DecEq String` /
`Ord String` instances are a **tracked follow-on**, not delivered here. This WP
delivers the *functions*; it does **not** ship the lawful instances — filing the
functions as proof-carrying instances would over-claim the trust level.

#### 2.5.1 String ordering — the 3-way `compare` and `OrdResult`

`compare` is a **3-way** codepoint-wise comparison — the more fundamental
ordering op, subsuming `≤` / `<` / `==` (a `leq`-only interface cannot cheaply
recover 3-way). The landed `Ord Char` is `leq`-valued only (`= leq_int`, no
`compare` method), so the surface declares a **local** result type and
**repackages** the landed Char ops:

```
data OrdResult = Lt | Eq | Gt              -- exported from the string surface

compare_char a b =                          -- 3-way from landed leqChar / eqChar
  match eqChar a b {
    True  => Eq
    False => match leqChar a b { True => Lt ; False => Gt }
  }

compare a b = list_compare compare_char (s2l a) (s2l b)   -- : OrdResult
```

Three normative points (Architect ruling `evt_1stp9sspm6ag8`):

- **Named `OrdResult`, not `Ordering`** — matching the landed `natCmp` precedent
  (`val1_string_literals.rs:334`) and ES2's retired-from-prelude name; do not
  introduce a second name for the concept.
- **Local to the string surface and exported.** ES2 retired `OrdResult` from the
  *prelude* as un-referenced bloat, and explicitly sanctions a *local*
  declaration where genuinely needed (the sanction-comment sits on the `val1`
  precedent); a string `compare` is a genuine 3-way need. It is **not**
  re-promoted to the prelude here — that would reopen ES2's retirement, and one
  consumer does not justify prelude-global (YAGNI). **Forward note (not this
  WP):** when a *second* consumer lands (verified `sort` / `Map`/`Set` ordering
  will want the same type), that WP raises "≥2 consumers → promote `OrdResult`
  to a shared location" as a subsume decision to the Steward.
- **`compare_char` repackages, it does not re-derive.** Settled input #4 forbids
  re-*deriving* a Char comparison; `compare_char` reuses the landed `leqChar` /
  `eqChar` verbatim and only wraps their results 3-way. It is a faithful 3-way
  of the landed total order (`Eq` on `eqChar`; else `Lt` / `Gt` by `Ord Char`'s
  antisymmetry + totality) and a `declare_def` — a bug is a wrong value, never a
  false proof. **Zero-TCB-delta:** `OrdResult` is a **checked inductive**
  (kernel-admitted by positivity, not a postulate/primitive), and `compare_char`
  / `list_compare` are `declare_def`s.

### 2.6 The structural byte view — `Bytes ↔ List UInt8`

`Bytes` has a total structural view parallel to `String ↔ List Char`:

```
bytes_to_list : Bytes → List UInt8
list_to_bytes : List UInt8 → Bytes
```

The pair is native because `Bytes` is an opaque packed buffer: ordinary Ken
cannot inspect or construct its representation. Interpreter evaluation maps
each byte to the corresponding `UInt8` element in source order and rebuilds
the identical byte buffer in the inverse direction. Both operations are total.

The representation guarantee is available to proofs through two named
propositions:

```
bytes_list_roundtrip : (bs : Bytes) →
  Equal Bytes (list_to_bytes (bytes_to_list bs)) bs

list_bytes_roundtrip : (xs : List UInt8) →
  Equal (List UInt8) (bytes_to_list (list_to_bytes xs)) xs
```

The propositions are registered postulates. This is a deliberate fixed trust
cost: primitive operations compute in the interpreter but remain opaque to
kernel conversion, so `Refl` cannot prove either equation. Registering the two
guarantees once prevents each consumer from adding its own cached length and
`Axiom`. The exact `trusted_base()` growth is therefore the two primitive
operations plus these two propositions, all four named and audited.

Every other byte traversal is derived. The initial surface operation is the
ordinary structural fold

```
bytes_nat_length bs = length UInt8 (bytes_to_list bs)
```

which reuses the termination-checked generic `List` length and adds nothing to
`trusted_base()`. Further byte algorithms compose ordinary `List UInt8`
functions with the view and inverse; they are not additional native byte
operations. Existing cached-`Nat` carriers remain source-compatible but are no
longer required for new folds.

## 3. The core collection types

| Type | Kind | Lowering | Equality |
|---|---|---|---|
| `List a` | transparent inductive `data` (L2) | `data List a = Nil \| Cons a (List a)` (`34 §1`) | structural |
| `Array a` | abstract persistent sequence | durable tag `0x06` (`41 §3a`); runtime representation private | structural |
| `Map k v` | proved package (`Ord k`-keyed) | ordered BST `data Tree k v` over `Ord k` (`50-stdlib/52`) | extensional, via ordered `to_list` |
| `Set a` | proved package (`Ord a`-keyed) | `Map a Unit` (`50-stdlib/52`) | extensional, via ordered `to_list` |
| `Option a` | transparent inductive `data` (L2) | `data Option a = None \| Some a` (`34 §1`) | structural |
| `Result e a` | transparent inductive `data` (L2) | `data Result e a = Err e \| Ok a` (`34 §1`) | structural |

`List`, `Option`, and `Result` are closed prelude identities (`30 §4`), not
optional packages: public primitive signatures name each of them. The same
`bytes_decode` signature also places its `Utf8Error` family in the prelude.
Their ordinary `data` derivations explain why they add no trust; they do not make
those canonical compiler-installed identities recreatable under a second source
`GlobalId`.

All core collections are **immutable and persistent**: an "update" returns a
new value and leaves the input unchanged. Copying, structural sharing, and
allocation are private runtime choices (`41 §2`). Mutation, where genuinely
needed, lives only in a `space` (`36 §4`), never in a collection value.

### 3.1 `List` — the transparent inductive (canonical for proofs)

`List a` is the ordinary inductive `data` of `34 §1`: `Nil`/`Cons`, pattern-
matchable, consumed by `elim_List` (`34 §3`). It is the **canonical** collection
for verification — `match`, structural recursion, and the per-branch refinement
of `34 §3.3` all apply directly. `List` is **transparent**: a program may
`match` on its constructors. (`Option`/`Result` are the same L2 story, reused
here, not re-declared.)

### 3.2 `Array` — the persistent index tree (abstract)

`Array a` is an **abstract type** (`33 §4` module abstraction): an opaque
carrier plus a lawful interface (`get`, `set`, `push`, `length`,
`from_list`/`to_list`). It is persistent: update returns a new array while the
old array remains unchanged. Its runtime representation is private.

- **Index profile.** An implementation may advertise an index-complexity
  profile; no branching factor, tree shape, or flat-buffer representation is
  semantic.
- **Persistent update.** `set i x` preserves every element except index `i`,
  leaves the source array unchanged, and returns the updated value. Physical
  structural sharing is permitted but not observable.

`Array` is **abstract**, so it is consumed through its interface, never by
`match` on its internal tree; the exact branching factor / representation
(RRB-tree, HAMT-vector, chunk size) is an `(oracle)`/X2 tuning (`§8`), invisible
to the laws.

### 3.3 `Map` and `Set` — proved package trees over `Ord k` (`50-stdlib/52`)

`Map k v` and `Set a` are **proved, pure `catalog/packages/` modules** keyed on a lawful
**`Ord k`**, specified in `../50-stdlib/52-map.md`. **This supersedes an earlier
DRAFT** that made them abstract `DecEq`-keyed content-addressed heap primitives
(kinds `0x07`/`0x08`) — operator decision **OQ-A** (2026-07-03) chose *proved +
pure + zero-TCB* over the runtime-O(1) heap form:

- **Proved, out of `trusted_base()`.** The carrier is an ordinary inductive
  `data Tree k v = Leaf | Node …` and every correctness law (`Ordered`
  invariant, `lookup`-after-`insert`, ordered `to_list`) is a **real kernel
  proof** — so `Map` is derived Ken, **not** the `declare_primitive` audited
  primitive it was (retired, `30 §6`). "Proved" *requires* this: an opaque
  primitive has no eliminator, so its laws could only be `Axiom` (`50-stdlib/52
  §1.1`).
- **`Ord k` is the single keying constraint**, throughout — a search tree needs
  the order for its *core* operations (`lookup`/`insert` descend by `leq`). This
  replaces the earlier "`DecEq` for membership, `Ord` for ordered ops" split;
  key identity is derived from the order (`leq k k' ∧ leq k' k`), and the
  `Ord.antisym → Equal` step used for overwrite carries **ADR 0010's
  canonical-carrier requirement** (sound for `Int`/`Char`/`Bool`, `50-stdlib/52
  §2.1`).
- **Identity is extensional, not representational.** Two maps are equal via
  their ordered `to_list` (`50-stdlib/52 §5.3`), regardless of insertion
  history or private tree/storage representation.

`Set a` is **`Map a Unit`** (`50-stdlib/52 §4.4`).

### 3.4 Persistence is observable; sharing is private

Updating a collection returns a new value and leaves the source unchanged.
Implementations may share unchanged substructure, copy it, or use another
private representation. Conformance asserts the old and new values and their
elements, never pointer or slot identity. Mutable cells exist only in a
`space` (`36 §4`).

## 4. Iteration and combinators (laws as propositions)

**Structural recursion / `match`** is the primitive way to consume `List` and
other inductives (`34 §3`); it is what the verification layer reasons over. The
higher-order combinators — `map`, `filter`, `fold`/`reduce`, `zip` — are
ordinary **prelude `view`s** over the collection interfaces (`../50-stdlib/`),
**not** a kernel iteration protocol. Comprehensions / `for`, if included, are
**sugar** over the combinators (`OQ-syntax`); the semantic core is combinators +
recursion.

The **laws are propositions** (`14 §5`, `21 §3`), stated and proved in the
prelude, usable by the verification layer — they add **no kernel rule**:

```
-- functor laws (for List, Array, Option, …)
map_id    : map id xs           ≡ xs
map_comp  : map (g ∘ f) xs       ≡ map g (map f xs)
-- fold / fusion
fold_fusion : h (fold f z xs)    ≡ fold f' (h z) xs        -- given the fusion premise
-- Map lookup/insert (the canonical algebraic spec)
lookup_insert_eq  : lookup k (insert k v m)            ≡ Some v
lookup_insert_neq : k ≠ k' → lookup k (insert k' v m)  ≡ lookup k m
```

These are `≡`-propositions over the combinators/operations, dischargeable by the
prover (AC3 observes the **emitted obligation** structurally, not "it
compiles"). A combinator law in one declaration may reference a combinator
defined in **another** declaration (`map_id` references `map`): this
**cross-declaration lowercase reference** is supported by the landed
`L-resolver-globals` fallback (`c3a3f1d`: an `EVar` scope-miss falls through to
a global `RCon` lookup, locals still shadowing globals) — the L2-build resolver
limitation the frame flagged is **resolved**, verified against the on-`main`
elaborator. No resolver sub-WP is required for L3.

### 4.1 The `List Char` combinator floor (derived, zero-TCB-delta)

The `§2.5` string surface bottoms out in a small floor of **generic** `List a` /
`Nat` combinators. Each is a **termination-checked recursive derived def** — a
member of a `declare_recursive_group`, kernel-checked, `sct_check`-certified,
and `declare_def`-registered (upgrading opaque → transparent on SCT success).
They lower to the **real** eliminators: a `match` on the recursive argument
elaborates to a `Term::Elim` over the `List` / `Nat` family (`34 §3`) — **not**
a bespoke reducer, and **not** a registered `elim_List` / `elim_Nat` constant
(there is no such constant; the eliminator is the generic `Term::Elim { fam }`).
Because they are `declare_def`s (checked), the floor adds **zero**
`trusted_base()` delta.

Every recursion shape here already elaborates + SCT-passes on `main` — the
de-risking precedent is in `crates/ken-elaborator/tests/l3a_acceptance.rs` (and,
for `nat_sub`, `crates/ken-elaborator/tests/val1_string_literals.rs`), per the
Architect capability confirm (`evt_4k1yqah3yvpds`):

| Combinator | Signature | Recursion (decreasing arg) | Landed precedent |
|---|---|---|---|
| `list_append` | `{a} → List a → List a → List a` | 1st list, `Cons` tail | `map` (simpler than) |
| `nth` | `{a} → Nat → List a → Option a` | `Cons` tail + `Suc` pred | `map` |
| `take` | `{a} → Nat → List a → List a` | `Suc` pred (`Nat` fuel) | `unfoldUpTo` |
| `drop` | `{a} → Nat → List a → List a` | `Suc` pred (`Nat` fuel) | `unfoldUpTo` |
| `nat_sub` | `Nat → Nat → Nat` | `Suc` preds (saturating) | `nat_sub` (val1) |
| `list_eq` | `{a} → (a→a→Bool) → List a → List a → Bool` | both `Cons` tails | `zip` |
| `list_compare` | `{a} → (a→a→OrdResult) → List a → List a → OrdResult` | both `Cons` tails | `zip` / `insert` |

The frame named **6** combinators; this is **7** — `nat_sub` (the saturating
`Nat` monus `slice` needs, `§2.5`; the frame assumed a landed `sub` that does
not exist) and `list_compare` over the locally-declared `OrdResult` (`§2.5.1`;
`list_compare` replaces the frame's `list_compare : … → Ordering`, which named a
type that does not exist — Architect ruling `evt_1stp9sspm6ag8`). Both are the
same Approach-A derived-def shape; the delta is a count-note, not a soundness
change.

**Mandated defining equations** (structural — every recursive call is an
**applied** call whose decreasing argument is a **strict subterm** of a matched
argument, `elim`-driven, `34 §3`). Shown with implicit `{a}` and pattern
clauses; the build follows the landed explicit-type-argument, nested-`match`
style (`l3a_acceptance.rs`). `OrdResult`'s `Lt`/`Eq`/`Gt` are from `§2.5.1`:

```
list_append Nil          ys = ys
list_append (Cons x xs)  ys = Cons x (list_append xs ys)

nth _        Nil          = None
nth Zero     (Cons x _)   = Some x
nth (Suc n)  (Cons _ xs)  = nth n xs

- **AC2 — SCT sound-zone (soundness, Architect brief-condition 1).** Confirm
  per-combinator that the recursive call is an **applied** call decreasing on a
  strict subterm — the `Cons` tail (`list_append` / `nth` / `take` / `drop` /
  `list_eq` / `list_compare`) or the `Suc` predecessor (`nth` / `take` / `drop`
  / `nat_sub`). The floor does **not** lean on the SCT to bless *unapplied*
  self-reference or recursion-through-an-opaque type, where the SCT
  over-accepts (a bare self-`Const` is modelled all-`Unknown` and **rejected**;
  certification requires an applied call carrying a `Down` argument,
  `ken-kernel/src/sct.rs`).
  None of these combinators need that shape — the check is a cheap, concrete
  per-combinator confirmation, squarely in the SCT's sound zone.
- **AC6 — name hygiene (Architect brief-condition 2).** `list_append` is a
  **distinct** name; it must **not** shadow the `Bytes`-domain `append`
  (FS-effect — `append : Bytes → Bytes → Bytes visits [FS]`,
  `crates/ken-elaborator/src/bytes.rs`). Module-qualify if the surface would
  otherwise resolve the wrong op. The other floor names are currently free —
  `nth` / `take` / `drop` / `nat_sub` / `list_eq` / `list_compare` do not collide
  with landed globals (grep-verified at authoring; re-verify at build).
- **Totality (AC7).** Each combinator is total on well-typed input — `nat_sub`
  **saturates** at `0` (never underflows), `nth` totalizes out-of-range to
  `None`, `take` / `drop` totalize out-of-range to `Nil` / the remainder. No
  well-typed application reduces to `Neutral` / stuck.

## 5. Infinitude without coinduction

Ken serves genuine infinitude with **inductive, total** idioms — *staged by what
they depend on*, so the build team's **mandated** demonstration rests only on
**landed L2** machinery and never on a deferred primitive (a defer-spelling-not-
concept corollary: a buildable-now deliverable must not depend on a deferred
spelling — see the B2 carry). In dependency order:

1. **Fuel-bounded inductive unfold — buildable now, L2 only (the mandated
   demonstration).** A structurally-recursive unfold to a finite prefix:

   ```
   unfoldUpTo : (s → Option (a × s)) → Nat → s → List a
   unfoldUpTo step Zero    s = Nil
   unfoldUpTo step (Suc n) s = match step s {
     None          => Nil
     Some (a , s') => Cons a (unfoldUpTo step n s')
   }
   ```

   This terminates by structural descent on the `Nat` fuel — an **ordinary total
   `List`-producing function** over the landed `34 §1` `data` (`List`, `Option`,
   `Nat`) with **no** coinductive value, **no** `Lazy`, **no** effect. `take n`
   over a generating step is exactly this. **This is the AC4-mandated working
   demonstration** — it rests solely on the pinned/landed concept.
2. **`Lazy a` streams (rides `42 §2`; force/memo may be deferred for G1).** An
   explicit lazy sequence on the opt-in `Lazy` thunk (`42 §2`) with a fuel/depth
   bound (`take n`), finite-by-construction at every use. **Staging flag:** `42
   §2` defers the `Lazy` force/memo primitive for G1; this idiom is therefore
   **not** the buildable-now demonstration — it lands when `Lazy` does. (This is
   precisely why item 1, not this one, is the mandated deliverable.)
3. **Generators (`view … visits [Yield]`, rides L5).** A finite-step effectful
   producer (`36`): each step terminates; the "ongoing" is the consumer's loop,
   not an infinite value. Available once L5 effects are in play.
4. **The behavioral seam (`36 §4`, Ward).** A genuinely forever-running process
   is a `space`/actor with a **total per-message handler**; the "forever" lives
   in the runtime loop + Ward's temporal model (`../70-behavioral/`), never in a
   Ken value.

A `Stream`/`Iterator` is a **library type over these idioms**, not a language
primitive — and crucially, none of the four introduces a coinductive type or a
productivity checker (`§7`).

## 6. Equality, ordering, and the verified `sort`

**Equality** is structural and extensional (`41 §4`); `DecEq` (`33 §5`) makes it
usable in constraints (its `eq` returns `Bool` with the `ok` law tying it to the
kernel's `Eq`); `Eq` (observational equality, `15`/`16`) is the propositional
version proofs use. `DecEq` is a **structure class** (`33 §5`): genuinely many
can exist per carrier, so it follows the canonical-instance resolver convention.

**Ordering — explicit comparator, with the lawful `Ord` class supplying it
(ES2-remainder pin `evt_3cn9v6em54yej`; class realized by ES4-classes,
`../50-stdlib/51-lawful-classes.md`).** The verified `sort` threads an
**explicit comparator** `leq : a → a → Bool` — the minimal mechanism that yields
a real, prover-unfoldable specification. The **lawful `Ord a` structure class**
(its total-order law fields — reflexivity of `≤`, antisymmetry, transitivity,
totality — *proved* not postulated) is defined in `51-lawful-classes.md`; per
`33 §5.4`, `where Ord a` **subsumes** the explicit comparator by supplying the
dictionary's `leq` (`d.leq`) to this **same** `sort` — no second `sort`, no new
mechanism (reflect-don't-extend). It is `Ord`'s `total`/`antisym` laws that let
a verified `sort` *discharge* the sortedness obligation this explicit-comparator
form only *states*. Ordered `Map`/`Set` operations (`§3.3`) likewise use
built-in comparators (the L-classes boundary below).

**The verified `sort` (the canonical verification example).** `sort` takes an
explicit comparator and produces a **refinement-typed** result (`34 §5`):

```
view sort {a} (leq : a → a → Bool) (xs : List a)
    : { ys : List a | is_sorted leq ys ∧ Perm ys xs } = …
```

This matches the landed AC6 `sort` surface exactly (`l3a_acceptance.rs`, the
`leq : a → a → Bool` comparator after the ES2 `OrdResult → Bool` migration) — no
`where`-constraint threading, no new surface. The refinement carries **two**
conjuncts, and the second is **load-bearing**:

- `is_sorted leq ys` — `ys` is in non-decreasing `leq`-order (a decidable
  refinement predicate, `34 §5`).
- `Perm ys xs` — `ys` is a **permutation** of the input (comparator-free).

`is_sorted`-**alone is degenerate**: `sort _ = Nil` satisfies
`{ ys | is_sorted leq ys }` (the empty list is vacuously sorted), so a
sortedness-only spec is met by a **constant-`Nil`** implementation that throws
the input away — it guards nothing
(the discriminating-example / refinement-must-not-be-vacuous discipline). The
`Perm ys xs` conjunct is what forces `sort` to actually *be* a sort. The
elaboration **emits the conjoined obligation**
`is_sorted leq (sort leq xs) ∧ Perm (sort leq xs) xs` on the result introduction
(`34 §5`, `22 §2.1`); a verified
`sort` discharges it with a bundled proof (AC6 observes the **emitted VC**
structurally — per the untrusted-layer lesson, the obligation must be *emitted*,
not assumed).

**The refinement predicates are definitions, not postulates (ES1).** The
obligation `is_sorted leq (sort leq xs) ∧ Perm (sort leq xs) xs` is dischargeable
only if the prover can **unfold** `is_sorted` and `Perm` — so both are
**definitions** (`Ω`-valued, re-checked, **out** of `trusted_base()`), never
opaque postulates. As `declare_postulate`s (their current `prelude.rs` form) the
predicates are **undefined**: `is_sorted leq (sort leq xs)` cannot reduce, so the
obligation is either **undischargeable** or discharged **circularly** (the proof
assuming the
conclusion), and the flagship verified `sort` would prove **nothing**
(`30 §6`, the surface-minimality invariant; ES2 lands the demotion). The
defining shapes:

- **`is_sorted : Π(a : Type). (a → a → Bool) → List a → Ω`** — an `Ω`-valued
  structural recursion over the **explicit comparator**: `is_sorted leq Nil = ⊤`,
  `is_sorted leq (x :: Nil) = ⊤`, and
  `is_sorted leq (x :: y :: r) = IsTrue (leq x y) ∧ is_sorted leq (y :: r)` (the
  connective is the derived Ω-conjunction `And`, `16 §1.3`; the recursion
  descends structurally on the list, so it terminates). The comparator is
  `Bool`-valued (matching the landed `sort`), so the order relation enters `Ω`
  through the **bridge** `IsTrue (leq x y) := Eq Bool (leq x y) True : Ω` — a
  proof-irrelevant proposition (both `Bool` as real `data Bool = True | False`
  and `Eq _ : Ω` are landed by ES2). It **must** land in `Ω` (proof-irrelevant);
  a `Type`-sorted "predicate" leaks content into the refinement carrier
  (`13 §4` / `16 §8.2`). (With the lawful `Ord a` class,
  `../50-stdlib/51-lawful-classes.md`, `where Ord a` supplies this **same**
  `leq : a → a → Bool` from the dictionary — the `IsTrue` bridge is
  **unchanged**; the class changes only *where* `leq` comes from, `33 §5.4`.)
- **`Perm : Π(a : Type). List a → List a → Ω`** — a permutation **must** be
  `Ω`-valued, and a bare inductive relation is **not**:
  `data Perm_rel := perm_refl | perm_swap | perm_trans | perm_cons` is
  proof-**relevant** (a proof records *which* permutation) so it lands in
  `Type`, and `16 §1.3` **forbids** a proof-relevant `Type → Ω` directly (it
  would admit `Bool`, collapsing `true ≡ false` by Ω-PI). **Pinned form
  (ES2-remainder ruling `evt_3cn9v6em54yej`, closing ES1's "spec picks one"
  fork) — the truncation:**

  `Perm xs ys := ∥ Perm_rel xs ys ∥ : Ω`

  — propositional truncation of the `Type`-level inductive (the `∨ := ∥+∥` /
  `∃ := ∥Σ∥` pattern, `16 §6`; proof-irrelevant). It is **comparator-free** and
  carries **no `DecEq a` / `Ord a` dependency** — the decisive reason to prefer
  it. The rejected alternative, **count-equality**
  `Perm xs ys := Π (x : a). Eq Nat (count x xs) (count x ys)`, is natively `Ω`
  (a `Π` of `Eq`s) but requires `DecEq a` to `count` occurrences (counting
  compares elements) — dragging in exactly the class dependency this ruling
  defers. `Perm` therefore uses the truncation, **not** count-equality.

  Declaring the bare inductive `: Ω` is the relevance leak `16 §1.3`/`13 §4`
  forbid (CV's table surfaced this fork; CV-Spec blocked on it).

Neither is prelude: no primitive signature names either one, and neither has
an independent bootstrap-identity witness (`30 §4`). They are the
verified-`sort` showcase's own definitions.

**L-classes staging boundary (flag, do not resolve).** The collection **types**
and **structural equality** ship in L3 with **built-in** `DecEq`/`Ord` instances
for the primitive and core types (the L1-numerics precedent: built-in now). Full
**user-type instancing** of `DecEq`/`Ord` (a user `instance DecEq MyType`)
depends on **L-classes** (`33 §5`/`39`) and is **gated** there — L3 pins the
boundary, it does not deliver user instancing.

## 7. No coinductive type / no productivity checker (structural absence)

The §1 decision is enforced by a **structural-absence** net — the
grep-for-forbidden-**construct** seal, pinned by the construct's signature, not
a lexeme (the B2/Sec1-N1 absence-discipline; lexemes collide with ordinary
vocabulary). A conforming kernel + surface MUST contain:

- **No coinductive type former** — no `codata` declaration form, no greatest-
  fixpoint type constructor, no `Stream`/`Colist` *kernel* type. (A library
  `Stream` built on `§5`'s idioms is fine — it is a `data`/`Lazy`/effect value,
  not a coinductive former.)
- **No `cofix` / co-pattern / copattern-matching** term former.
- **No productivity or guardedness checker** pass — the kernel's sole structural
  admission gate is **strict positivity** for inductives (`14 §8`) and the
  **SCT** termination measure for recursion (`17 §4`); there is **no** dual
  guardedness analysis.

**Named vocabulary collisions (so the net targets the construct, not the
word):** `Lazy` (`42 §2`) is a **thunk type**, not coinduction; "lazy" WHNF (`42
§2`) is the kernel's *conversion* strategy, not a productivity rule; a stdlib
`Stream` (`§5`) is a *library* type. The net asserts the **absence of the
construct** (`codata`/`cofix`/guardedness-pass AST node or kernel judgment), and
names these three benign homonyms so a build-team grep targets the AST/judgment,
not the string `lazy`/`stream`. This is **durable** (`OQ-coinduction` DECIDED).

## 8. Level-discipline reconcile and pinned-vs-deferred

**Level discipline (editorial — no new formation rule).** Every type here
instantiates a landed kernel rule; per the standing directive each is stated
with its level, and none adds a universe computation:

- **`String`** — a kernel **primitive** at `Type 0` (`14 §5`, `35 §2`); opaque
  constant, no formation rule.
- **`List a` / `Option a` / `Result e a`** — inductive `data` (`14 §1`); for `a
  : Type ℓ`, `List a : Type ℓ` (predicative, `12 §2`); `Result e a` at
  `max(level e, level a)`. The landed `14 §1` formation computes it — **no new
  rule** (`34 §7`).
- **`Array a` / `Set a`** — abstract types at `level a`; `Map k v` at `max(level
  k, level v)`. Abstract carriers over `41`'s heap, no universe bump.
- **Refinement `{ ys : List a | is_sorted leq ys ∧ Perm ys xs }`** — carrier
  `List a` at its level; the predicate is `Ω`-valued (`12 §5`/`16 §1`),
  discharged as a V3 obligation, **no** universe bump (`34 §5`/§7).

**Pinned here (do not reopen).** `String` = canonically encoded NFC UTF-8
primitive (not `List Char`); byte-length ≠ char-length; the four
convertible-view totalities (`§2.3`); collections immutable + persistent with
extensional observations; `List`/`Option`/`Result` transparent inductive,
`Array` abstract; `Map`/`Set` proved `Ord`-keyed package trees; the combinator
law set (`§4`); the fuel-bounded unfold as the buildable-now infinitude
demonstration; `sort`'s **`is_sorted ∧ Perm`** refinement; the no-coinduction
absence; the L-classes staging boundary.

**K3-deferred kernel/TCB gap (not an API deferral).** Registered
`PrimReduction::Op` computations are opaque to kernel conversion today (§2.4).
The interpreter behavior and operation signatures are pinned; only a future,
operator-approved conversion mechanism could make their literal applications
definitionally reduce. This chapter does not anticipate that decision with
`Refl` examples or invented reduction rules.

**`(oracle)`-deferred to the build team / X2 (spelling, not concept).** The
exact **method names** other than the landed primitive-core names
(`byte_length`, `char_length`, `string_to_list_char`, and
`list_char_to_string`) — for example `get` vs `index`; the
**`Array` internal representation**; whether the proved package spells `Set a`
as `Map a Unit`; the `DecodeError` payload of `Bytes → String`; the
comprehension/`for` surface (`OQ-syntax`). These are spelling or private
representation choices the laws and equality are invariant under; the proved
`Map`/`Set` contract itself lives in `50-stdlib/52`.

## 9. What WS-L must deliver here (L3, → L8) and acceptance

Deliver in the surface/elaborator + prelude (lowering to the landed `41`): UTF-8
`String` (byte/char views, the four conversions, `Char`); `List` (L2 `data`),
`Array` (persistent abstract carrier), `Option`/`Result` (L2); the
`map`/`filter`/`fold`/`zip` combinators with their laws as
propositions; the fuel-bounded-unfold infinitude idiom; structural equality +
`DecEq`/`Ord` (built-in instances now); and the verified `sort`. L8 extends this
to the full lawful stdlib; L3 **unblocks T3** (the test/property framework).

**Testable acceptance criteria.**

- **AC1 (`String` UTF-8 primitive, structural).** NFC-equivalent strings have
  identical durable canonical bytes and compare equal regardless of runtime
  representation. `byte_length ≠ char_length` on a multi-byte string (assert
  **both** runtime view values, not "compiles" and not a `Refl` proof);
  `String` is **not** `List Char` (the convertible view is a separate value).
- **AC2 (persistent collections, structural).** `List` pattern-matches (real
  `elim_List`, `34`); an `Array`/`Map` update returns a new value with the
  requested element changed, every other element preserved, and the source
  value unchanged. Do not assert a physical sharing strategy.
- **AC3 (lawful combinators, structural).** A functor/fold law (`map_id`, or
  `lookup_insert` for `Map`) is **provable as a proposition** — observe the
  **emitted obligation**, not "it type-checks"; the cross-declaration reference
  resolves (`L-resolver-globals`).
- **AC4 (NO coinduction — the headline guardrail).** Assert **no coinductive
  type former / `cofix` / productivity checker** (the `§7` structural-absence
  net, pinned by construct + the three named homonyms), **AND** a working
  **fuel-bounded `unfoldUpTo … n`** produces a finite `List` prefix —
  infinitude with no coinductive value, on landed L2 only.
- **AC5 (structural equality).** Structurally equal collections compare equal
  independently of runtime representation. The proved `Map`/`Set` carrier is
  keyed by lawful `Ord`; its accept/reject coverage lives in `50-stdlib/52`.
- **AC6 (the verified example, structural).** `sort` (threading the explicit
  `leq : a → a → Bool`) produces `{ ys | is_sorted leq ys ∧ Perm ys xs }` — the
  **conjoined** refinement obligation is **emitted** and dischargeable; assert
  the **`Perm` conjunct is present** (a sortedness-only obligation is degenerate
  — `const Nil` satisfies it). `is_sorted`/`Perm` are the pinned **definitions**
  (`§6`: explicit-comparator `is_sorted`, `Perm := ∥Perm_rel∥`), unfoldable — not
  postulates (the demotion is the ES2-remainder follow-on).

**Derived string surface — slice-2 acceptance (`§2.5` / `§2.5.1` / `§4.1`,
impl-ready).** The floor + 5 string ops, mapping the WP frame's AC1–AC7:

- **DS-AC1/AC5 (floor registered, zero-TCB-delta).** All **7** floor combinators
  (`§4.1`) and `compare_char` **producer-grep** as `declare_recursive_group` /
  `declare_def` members over the real `Term::Elim` (not hand-fed, not a bespoke
  reducer); `OrdResult` grep as a **checked inductive** (`data`, not a
  `declare_primitive` / `declare_postulate` / `declare_opaque`). `git diff
  origin/main -- crates/ken-kernel/` is **empty**; `trusted_base()` unchanged.
- **DS-AC2 (SCT sound-zone).** Each combinator's recursive call is an applied
  call on a strict subterm (`§4.1`) — not leaning on the SCT's over-accept zone.
- **DS-AC3 (5 ops evaluate correctly).** `concat` / `slice` / `char_at` / `eq`
  / `compare` runtime-evaluate to the **correct value** on a multi-byte corpus
  (reuse slice 1's boundary corpus, through the real `s2l`/`l2s`): `char_at` →
  `None` on out-of-range **and** empty; `slice` clamps, incl. `j < i → ""`.
  This is interpreter behavior, not a kernel-conversion or `Refl` claim.
- **DS-AC4 (`eq`/`compare` codepoint-wise, discriminating PAIR).** A
  **non-degenerate pair**: `eq` **accepts** two equal scalar sequences **and
  rejects** a differing pair (incl. a same-length, single-codepoint-differing
  pair); `compare` gives `Lt` / `Eq` / `Gt` correctly on the ordered triple
  `"a" < "ab" < "b"`. Assert the **result value**. **NFC-blindness is pinned at
  the `List Char` layer** — `list_eq eqChar` on a precomposed vs decomposed
  scalar sequence (NFC vs NFD of one grapheme, built directly as `List Char`)
  runtime-evaluates **unequal** *unconditionally*, pinning that NFC-eq was **not**
  smuggled in (ADR 0010 §3). Do **not** pin this on `String` *literals*:
  `String` is NFC-normalized at construction (`§2.1`), so the two literals
  merge to one value
  and `eq` on them is **`True`**; a literal-level pin would falsely fail then
  (the over-pin-a-deferred-behavior trap). Under real NFC, extensional `==` and
  codepoint-wise `eq` **agree** on `String` values.
- **DS-AC6 (name hygiene).** `list_append` does not shadow the `Bytes` `append`
  (`§4.1`); both resolve to their intended op.
- **DS-AC7 (round-trip / totality).** `concat`+`slice` compose sanely at runtime
  (e.g. `slice 0 (char_length a) (concat a b) ≡ a` on scalar-clean `a`);
  `list_append` associativity on a small corpus; every combinator total (no
  runtime `Neutral`/stuck). This does not assert definitional equality for the
  primitive operations under kernel conversion.

**Bytes structural-view acceptance (`§2.6`).** Both primitive directions are
total at runtime; both registered propositions have the exact stated dependent
types; `Refl` does not close either conversion-opaque equation. The named
`trusted_base()` delta is exactly `bytes_to_list`, `list_to_bytes`,
`bytes_list_roundtrip`, and `list_bytes_roundtrip`. The derived
`bytes_nat_length` drives a real termination-checked `List UInt8` fold, runs on
a non-empty byte buffer, and adds no consumer `Axiom` or cached-`Nat` carrier.

**Conformance:** `../../conformance/surface/collections/` — UTF-8
byte/char-length edge cases + the `Bytes → String` partial decode;
persistent-update source preservation; the combinator laws + `Map`
lookup/insert; the verified `sort` with the **`is_sorted ∧ Perm`** obligation;
the no-coinduction structural absence + the working `unfoldUpTo`; the
proved Map's lawful-`Ord` key boundary. Per-case verdict/structural-flip
**and** the cross-case sweep: every collection's equality is extensional and
independent of runtime representation (`41 §4`).

**QA gate (new-surface WP):** **producer-grep** the `String`/`Array`/`Map`/`Set`
**registration** in `ken-elaborator/src/` (and the `String` primitive in the
kernel primitive set, `18 §5`) **before** counting green — the types must route
through **real** registration, the combinator laws + `sort` through **real**
obligation emission (`22`), the `List` through **real** `elim_List`; **no**
synthetic collection literal or hand-fed obligation where a real elaboration is
asserted (the green-vs-green / hand-fed-deliverable net).
