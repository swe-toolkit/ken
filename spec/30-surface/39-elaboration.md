## 1. Role and the trust split

The elaborator is the largest, cleverest part of the front end —
implicit-argument insertion, unification, type inference, instance resolution,
`match` compilation, sugar expansion — and **none of it is trusted**. Its output
is a core term the kernel `check`s (`../10-kernel/18 §4`). Consequences:

- A bug in the elaborator yields an **ill-typed core term** the kernel
  **rejects**, or a *well-typed but unintended* term (caught by tests/specs) —
  **never** an unsound acceptance. This is why the surface can be rich and
  evolve quickly while the trusted base stays tiny (`../00-overview.md §3`).
- The elaborator MAY use unification, metavariables, heuristics, and search; the
  kernel has none of these (`../10-kernel/18 §3`). The two are deliberately
  asymmetric: cleverness outside, certainty inside.

## 2. What elaboration does

1. **Scope & resolution** — resolve names against the module environment (`33`),
   reject unbound/ambiguous references.
2. **Implicit insertion** — insert implicit arguments `{x:A}` (`32`, `33 §1`) at
   uses, creating metavariables for them.
3. **Type inference & unification** — a bidirectional, **Hindley–Milner +
   dependent** elaboration: propagate expected types inward (checking) and
   synthesize where needed (inference), solving metavariables by **unification**
   up to definitional equality (`../10-kernel/17`). Higher-order cases use
   pattern unification; genuine ambiguity is a reported error, not a guess.
4. **Universe/level inference** — solve level metavariables (`../10-kernel/12
   §4`), emitting explicit levels to the kernel.
5. **Instance resolution** — discharge `where C A` constraints (`33 §5`) by
   instance search (the algorithm: **§6**), inserting the found class-record (a
   proof of subobject membership). **Canonical & coherent** (`OQ-classes`): for
   structure classes
   exactly one canonical instance per (class, head-type) is searchable (orphans
   are rejected at declaration, `33 §5`); search is deterministic and
   structurally bounded (`../10-kernel/17 §4`); two viable candidates is a
   surface error naming both, never a silent pick; overlap is not permitted.
   Property (Ω-valued) classes resolve to any instance — all are equal. A
   wanted-but-non-canonical dictionary is supplied by passing a named instance
   value explicitly (not via search).
6. **`match` compilation** — translate `match` (`34 §3`) into nested `elim_D`
   (`../10-kernel/14 §3`) with the recovered **dependent motive**, and run
   **exhaustiveness + reachability** checking (`34 §4`).
7. **Sugar expansion** — telescopes (`../10-kernel/13 §3`), records → Σ (`33
   §2`), `if` → `elim_Bool`, contracts/refinements → the obligation encoding
   (`../20-verification/21 §6`, `22`), proof-claim forms (`prop` / `theorem` /
   attached `proof`) → ordinary checked proof terms over `Ω`, `do`/
   comprehensions (if any) → combinators, numeric literals →
   `fromInteger`/… (`35 §4`), layout → braces (`31 §6`); `@ct`-annotated
   expressions → IFC taint label on the interaction-tree perform node (`36 §3`,
   `../60-security/61 §5a`); `temporal{}`/`Temporal` surface notation →
   `Temporal` inductive data (`../70-behavioral/72`); `Wrapping[T]` / `+%` →
   wrapping-arithmetic primitives (`35 §3`).
8. **Obligation emission** — where a refinement/contract is introduced, emit the
   proof obligation (`../20-verification/22`) and leave a hole/`prove` slot.

### 2.1 Proof-returning dependent `match` motives

When a surface `match` is checked against a known expected type, motive recovery
is part of elaboration. For a proof-returning dependent `match` (`34 §3.5`), the
expected type is itself a proposition, commonly `Equal A lhs rhs`, whose operands
mention the scrutinee directly or through a transparent/reducible expression. The
elaborator MUST treat this as an ordinary dependent eliminator into `Ω`, not as a
non-dependent match whose proof result is inferred from the first arm.

The required elaboration contract is:

1. Infer the scrutinee core term `s` and type `D p̄ ī`; reject non-inductive
   scrutinees with the ordinary `match` type error.
2. Infer/classify the expected target `E[s]`. If it classifies as `Ω_l`, this is
   a proof motive; if it classifies as `Type l`, this is ordinary large
   elimination. These two cases are both valid sorts for `Term::Elim`
   (`../10-kernel/14 §3`). The elaborator MUST NOT force an `Ω` target through
   `Type`, and MUST NOT coerce a `Type` target into `Ω`.
3. Recover the motive by generalizing the expected target over the scrutinee and
   indices: `M = λī x. E[x]`. Transparent aliases and reducible heads needed to
   expose the dependency, including `Equal` unfolding to kernel `Eq`
   (`../50-stdlib/53 §1`), are handled by the same WHNF/transparent-unfolding
   discipline used elsewhere in elaboration. If multiple incomparable
   generalizations remain possible, report an ambiguity/unsupported-dependent-
   motive error; do not choose one silently.
4. For each constructor method, check the branch body against the specialized
   target `E[cₖ fields]` under the constructor telescope and branch refinement
   (`34 §3.3`), including every direct, Π-abstracted, or nested lifted IH in the
   generated method type (`14 §3`–`§3.2`). A branch proof for `E[cᵢ ...]` is
   not acceptable in the `cₖ` branch unless the two propositions are
   definitionally equal after the existing kernel reductions. `Ω` proof
   irrelevance applies only after this type check succeeds at the same
   proposition.
5. Emit `Term::Elim { motive = M, methods, indices = ī, scrut = s }` and run
   the ordinary kernel re-check. The emitted motive may be an ascribed lambda
   when needed so the kernel can infer its codomain sort.

**Audit boundary.** A build that touches this area must classify failures at the
following layers, using Ken-owned reproducers rather than CAT-4 proof-search
speculation:

- **Surface motive construction.** Wrong abstraction of `E[s]` over the
  scrutinee or indices is an elaborator bug. If the emitted core is ill-typed,
  the kernel rejects fail-closed; an elaborator-only fix remains outside the
  TCB so long as `crates/ken-kernel`, `Cargo.lock`, and `trusted_base()` are
  unchanged.
- **Proof-sort handling.** A Type-vs-Omega failure on an otherwise well-formed
  proof motive means some layer tried to classify `Ω_l` as `Type l` (or the
  reverse). If this is in motive recovery, route Language. If the kernel's
  `Term::Elim` checker rejects a motive whose codomain is `Ω_l`, route Kernel
  plus Architect because `14 §3` already admits `Ω`-codomain motives.
- **`Equal` lowering under branch refinement.** `Equal` is transparent to `Eq`;
  branch specialization substitutes the constructor form into the equality
  operands before `Refl`, `Proved`, `J`, `absurd`, or library transport is checked.
  A wrong-specialized branch must still reject. An acceptance of such a branch
  is a soundness issue, not an ergonomic diagnostic bug.
- **Kernel `Term::Elim` checking.** The kernel checks the motive against
  `(Δ_i) → D p̄ Δ_i → sort`, each method against the constructor-specialized
  method type, the indices, and the scrutinee (`../10-kernel/14 §3`). If the
  kernel rejects a core term that satisfies those obligations, the finding is a
  kernel completeness bug. If it accepts a method that does not satisfy the
  specialized target, the finding is a TCB soundness bug and requires Architect
  plus Kernel review before build continues.
- **Fail-closed posture.** An implementation may reject a valid proof-returning
  dependent match while the mechanism is incomplete. It may not accept by
  dropping the dependency, replacing the proof target with a constant `Top`, or
  using proof irrelevance before branch methods have checked at their exact
  propositions.

**Expected green/red shape.** The minimized regression for this mechanism should
be smaller than the CAT-4 map proof but preserve the same load-bearing shape:
an option-like or two-constructor scrutinee, a target `P[s] : Ω` such as
`Equal R (f s) (g s)`, and branch bodies that close locally at `P[C0]` and
`P[C1 x]`. The positive case accepts. A sibling where one branch supplies a
proof for the other branch's specialized target rejects. A whole-body
`KernelRejected { TypeMismatch { expected: Type 0, found: Omega0 } }` on this
shape is not an acceptable final diagnostic; it must be classified to one of the
audit layers above.

**Mechanism split rule.** The semantic rule is one rule: dependent elimination
into a proof target. If the minimized reproducer shows separable implementation
work, split implementation only along these boundaries:

- **proof-motive sort recovery** — `Ω` vs `Type` motive classification and
  branch checking for a single-scrutinee proof target; this is required here;
- **generalized scrutinee dependency** — targets that mention a reducible term
  equal to a non-variable scrutinee, nested/multi-scrutinee matrix recovery, or
  other occurrence-selection ambiguity; split only if absent from the minimized
  required seed;
- **indexed-family dependent match** — non-empty index telescopes and
  index-impossible method synthesis remain the existing `34 §4.3`/L2-indexed
  surface unless the minimized proof-motive reproducer truly depends on them.

### 2.2 Dependent constructor declaration elaboration

For an explicit family declaration (`32 §1`, `34 §2`):

```ken
data D (Δ_p) : (Δ_i) -> Type where {
  C : (Δ_k) -> D Δ_p t̄
}
```

elaboration constructs the kernel inductive-family declaration of `14 §1`; it
does not encode constructors as opaque constants, records, smart constructors,
or class dictionaries.

The required elaboration contract is:

1. Elaborate the data-head parameter telescope `Δ_p` and classify the type after
   the colon as an index telescope `Δ_i` ending in `Type ℓ`. A declaration whose
   head does not end in a universe is a data-head error, not a kernel-family
   declaration.
2. For each constructor, elaborate its signature in the context `Γ, Δ_p`.
   Peeling leading explicit binders, implicit binders, and anonymous arrows
   gives the constructor telescope `Δ_k`. Earlier constructor binders are in
   scope for later argument types and for the final result indices.
3. Check the constructor codomain against the declared family: after ordinary
   transparent unfolding and WHNF exposure, it must be definitionally equal to
   `D p̄ ī`, where `p̄` are the data-head parameters in order and `ī` has the
   declared index arity. The index expressions are elaborated in `Γ, Δ_p, Δ_k`.
4. Emit the kernel constructor signature `(Δ_k) -> D p̄ ī` and the enclosing
   kernel inductive declaration. The kernel remains responsible for type
   checking constructor argument types, universe levels, strict positivity,
   W-style admission, nested structural admission, mutual rejection, and
   eliminator generation (`14 §1`/`§8`).
5. When a constructor argument contains recursive values through a declared
   strictly-positive parameter path, elaborate its methods against the
   source-indexed `All`-family application generated by `14 §3.2`. That type is
   available before any method body exists; method checking never depends on a
   completed method vector. A nested match refines the containing value and its
   `All` inhabitant in lockstep, using the aligned host/internal constructors.
   The corresponding branch context receives the motive instance for each
   exposed recursive child and the residual `All` inhabitant for each exposed
   enclosing child. Direct leaves, Π/W-style leaves, primitive Σ components,
   and composed positive-former paths follow the same structural projection.
   Structural recursion and proof-returning branch elaboration consume those
   entries; they do not synthesize an unchecked self-call, erase the lift, or
   expose the generated internal family and constructor names as surface names.

**Diagnostics and staging.**

- A result codomain whose exposed head is not `D`, whose parameters are not the
  declared data-head parameters, whose index arity is wrong, or whose codomain is
  not a family application is reported as a **bad constructor result target**
  naming the constructor and the expected family head.
- A negative recursive occurrence, a nested occurrence through an unknown or
  non-positive parameter, or a mutual-family shape is routed through the kernel
  admission verdict and surfaced at the constructor span; the elaborator does
  not implement a second positivity checker. A nested occurrence through
  declared strictly-positive parameters remains a staged rejection until
  `KERNEL-NESTED-IND` lands, after which it must carry the lifted method context
  of item 5.
- `{x : A} -> ...` in a constructor signature is an implicit telescope binder.
  Named-argument application and record-field labels inside explicit dependent
  constructor signatures are intentionally staged out; the old `C { f : A }`
  shorthand remains default-result sugar only.
- CAT-5 D3 is not implemented here and must not be routed through this feature.
  The CAT-5 `Source` surface remains governed by the existing CAT-5 contract and
  the immediate unblocker remains `KM-sigma-projection-execution`.

### 2.3 Structural-result association

When match compilation creates the branch environment described by `34
§3.1.1`, it derives each structural-result association from the checked method
telescope. It does not infer an association from source names, constructor
names, a field's ordinary type alone, or an owner self-call.

For every nested structural occurrence that supplies a recursive method result,
the elaborator must establish one relation among the resolved source-field
binding, its structural support evidence, and that exact recursive method result.
The relation is valid only when all three belong to the same enclosing method
and support instance, designate the same structural occurrence, are in range,
and are one-to-one in both directions. A result or evidence term cannot serve
two fields, and a field cannot select two results. Validation precedes branch-
body elaboration; failure rejects the enclosing `match` without a guessed,
positional, or name-derived fallback.

For `structural result of x`, name resolution first resolves `x` to one surface
binding. The form elaborates only when that binding has exactly one validated
association in the current branch environment, and then emits the associated
hidden result term directly. The elaborator never publishes the hidden term's
name, adds a constructor-pattern field, changes the type of `x`, or rewrites an
ordinary call to obtain it. An arbitrary association satisfying the rule is
accepted without appearing in a carrier or constructor allow-list.

Direct recursive and W-style fields do not acquire this association from their
existing direct/abstracted induction hypotheses. Their established match and
self-call elaboration is unchanged, including when they occur in the same
program as a nested structural field.

## 3. What elaboration must guarantee

- **Well-typed output.** Every emitted core term `check`s in the kernel; if it
  cannot produce one, it reports a precise surface error (not a kernel error).
- **No guessing past ambiguity.** Unsolved metavariables or ambiguous instances
  are surface errors with locations, never silently defaulted (except the
  *declared* defaults: numeric literals `35 §4`, level typical-ambiguity `12
  §4`).
- **Faithful sugar.** Desugaring preserves the surface's intended meaning; the
  round-trip (surface → core → behaviour) matches the surface semantics the
  chapters specify.
- **Totality routing.** Recursive definitions are emitted as eliminator
  applications where structural, else as δ-definitions gated by the kernel's SCT
  (`../10-kernel/17 §4`); a totality failure is surfaced from the kernel's
  verdict.
- **Determinism.** Same surface input → same core output (modulo metavariable
  names), so diagnostics and the protocol (`../20-verification/25`) are stable.

## 4. Errors and diagnostics

- **Surface type errors** (unification failure, unbound name, non-exhaustive
  `match`, ambiguous instance) are reported by the elaborator with source spans
  — these are *L1* errors, distinct from *L2* verification failures
  (`../20-verification/24`).
- The elaborator SHOULD recover and continue (report multiple errors, support
  the LSP), but its *accepted* output is always kernel-checked. Partial programs
  with verification holes still elaborate (the holes are obligations, `22`);
  programs with *type* errors do not (they have no well-typed core image).

Structural-result failures are L1 surface errors and fail closed before a
branch body is emitted. Their stable diagnostic names and payloads are:

| Diagnostic | Raised when | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| **`StructuralResultOutOfScope`** | the operand of `structural result of x` resolves, but that binding has no exact structural-result association in the current branch | the selector span and resolved binding span |
| **`StructuralResultAssociationMissing`** | a nested structural occurrence requires an association, but no complete field/evidence/result triple can be derived | the enclosing match and source-field spans |
| **`StructuralResultAssociationDuplicate`** | a field, support-evidence term, or result term participates in more than one candidate association | the enclosing match span and every implicated source-field span |
| **`StructuralResultAssociationSwapped`** | otherwise local evidence/result terms are paired with different source fields or structural occurrences within the same support instance | the enclosing match span and both crossed field spans |
| **`StructuralResultAssociationForeign`** | an evidence or result term comes from another method, support instance, or enclosing match | the selector or enclosing-match span, the source-field span, and both provenance identities |

`UnboundName` remains the diagnostic when the operand identifier itself does not
resolve. None of the five structural-result diagnostics may recover by exposing
a hidden binder, extending a pattern, treating the ordinary field value as its
result, or synthesizing an owner self-call. Missing, duplicate, swapped, and
foreign associations reject the enclosing match even when a guessed pairing
would happen to type-check.

## 5. V0 — the minimal elaborator (Phase 1)

For the G1 vertical slice, V0 is a **minimal** elaborator: enough surface to
`parse → elaborate → kernel-check` a trivial dependently-typed program — named
functions (`view`), λ, application, local `let`, type ascription, the dependent
function type `(x : A) → B`, the universe `Type`, and a base type or two
referenced by name. The full inference, instances, `match`, sugar, and literals
grow in Phase 3 (WS-L, `§6`). Keeping V0 minimal de-risks the slice: it proves
the *pipeline shape* — surface → core → kernel verdict — before the elaborator's
complexity lands. V0's output is **kernel-re-checked** (the de Bruijn criterion,
`docs/PRINCIPLES.md`), so V0 is **not in the TCB**: a V0 bug yields a rejected
valid program or a poor diagnostic, never an unsound acceptance (`§1`).

This section pins V0 to implementation resolution. The subsections fix the exact
surface subset (`§5.1`), its concrete syntax and AST (`§5.2`), the
correctness-critical name-resolution-to-de-Bruijn pass (`§5.3`), the
bidirectional surface→core elaboration (`§5.4`), the end-to-end pipeline
(`§5.5`), the error taxonomy (`§5.6`), and the level-discipline reconcile
(`§5.7`). Anything not listed here is **out of V0** and owned by a later WP.

### 5.1 The V0 surface subset

V0's parser and elaborator handle **exactly** these forms — and nothing else
from `31`–`38`:

- **Declarations**
  - `view f (x : A) … : B = expr` — a named (possibly dependent) function; the
    binders `(x : A)` are a telescope desugaring to nested λ and Π (`§5.4`).
  - `let x : A = expr` — a top-level value definition.
- **Types** (the type-position grammar)
  - `(x : A) → B` — the dependent function type (Π); the non-dependent arrow
    `A → B` is the special case where `x ∉ B`.
  - `Type` — the universe, with an optional explicit level (`Type`, `Type 0`,
    `Type 1`, …); a bare `Type` gets an inferred level (`§5.7`).
  - a bare `ConId` — a base type referenced by name (e.g. `Nat`, `Bool`).
- **Expressions**
  - `λ x . expr` (ASCII `\ x . expr`) — λ-abstraction; binders are explicit.
  - `expr expr` — application (left-associative).
  - `ident` — a variable reference (resolved in `§5.3`).
  - `( expr : type )` — type ascription (a checking hint, `11 §1`).
  - `let x : A = expr; y : B = expr in expr` — one or more sequential local
    bindings; the one-binding form remains valid.

**Explicitly out of V0** (each owned elsewhere, do not absorb): `data`/`match`
(`34`, Team Language), `record`/modules (`33`), the proof-claim surface
(`prop` / `theorem` / attached `proof`, `20` / `33`), effects (`36`), FFI (`38`),
numeric and other literals (`35`), implicit arguments `{x : A}` and the
unification that inserts them (`§2.2`–`§2.3`), instance resolution (`§2.5`),
and `match` compilation (`§2.6`). All V0 arguments are **explicit**; V0
performs **no implicit insertion**.

**Base types.** V0 does not declare inductives. The base types it references
(`Nat`, `Bool`) are assumed **pre-declared** in the kernel environment `Σ` as
opaque constants at `Type 0` (`Nat : Type 0`, `Bool : Type 0`; `11 §4`,
`declare_postulate`, `18 §4`). V0 resolves a `ConId` by name against `Σ` and
emits the corresponding constant `c` (`11 §1`); it never synthesises a base
type's *values* (no literals in V0). The smallest end-to-end program needs no
base type at all:

```
view id (A : Type) (x : A) : A = x
```

parses (`§5.2`) → resolves names to de Bruijn indices (`§5.3`) → elaborates to a
core term (`§5.4`) → is accepted by the kernel's `check`/`infer` (`18 §3`).

### 5.2 The V0 parser (concrete syntax → surface AST)

V0 reads the **brace form** of the grammar; layout (`31 §6`) is OQ-syntax and
out of V0 scope. The token set is the minimal lexer of `31 §8`: the keywords
`view let in Type`, the punctuation `( ) : = . ;` and the arrow `->`/`→`, the λ
spelling `\`/`λ`, lowercase-initial `ident` (term variables) and
uppercase-initial `ConId` (base types). The concrete grammar is the minimal
EBNF of `32 §8`; reproduced here for the elaborator's view of it:

```
decl   ::= "view" ident binder+ (":" type)? "=" expr
         | "let"  ident (":" type)?         "=" expr
binder ::= "(" ident+ ":" type ")"
type   ::= "(" ident ":" type ")" "->" type    -- dependent Π
         | type "->" type                       -- non-dependent arrow
         | "Type" level?                         -- universe (level optional)
         | ConId                                 -- base type by name
expr   ::= ("\" | "λ") ident+ "." expr          -- lambda
         | expr expr                             -- application (left assoc)
         | "let" let_binding (";" let_binding)* "in" expr
         | "(" expr ":" type ")"                 -- ascription
         | ident                                 -- variable
         | ConId                                 -- base type used as a term
         | "Type" level?                         -- universe used as a term
let_binding ::= ident (":" type)? "=" expr
level  ::= NAT                                   -- 0, 1, 2, …
```

The last two atoms reflect that **types are terms** (`../10-kernel/11 §1`): a
base type (`Nat : Type 0`) and a universe (`Type n : Type (suc n)`) are ordinary
terms and may appear in expression position — e.g. the body of `let x : Type =
Type in x`. `->`/Π appears only in *type* position (after `:` or in a binder),
so a bare function type is not a V0 expression.

`->` is right-associative; application binds tightest; ascription `:` is
loosest (`32 §6`). The parser emits a **surface AST** carrying source spans on
every node (for `§5.6` diagnostics):

```
Decl ::= ViewDecl name (binder list) (Type option) Expr   -- params, result, body
       | LetDecl  name (Type option) Expr

Expr ::= EVar  name span                  -- unresolved: still a name
       | EApp  Expr Expr span
       | ELam  name Expr span               -- single binder (see desugaring below)
       | ELet  (nonempty LetBinding list) Expr span
       | EAsc  Expr Type span
       | ECon  name span                    -- base type used as a term
       | EUniv (level option) span          -- Type / Type n used as a term

LetBinding ::= name (Type option) Expr span -- name, annotation, RHS

Type ::= TPi   name Type Type span          -- (x : A) -> B   (x bound in B)
       | TArr  Type Type span               -- A -> B         (sugar: x ∉ B)
       | TUniv (level option) span          -- Type | Type n
       | TCon  name span                    -- base type ConId
       | TVar  name span                    -- a type-position variable (e.g. A)

binder ::= (name list) Type                 -- (x y z : A)
```

A type-position identifier may be a base type (`TCon`, uppercase) or a bound
type variable (`TVar`, lowercase, e.g. the `A` in `(A : Type) → A`); the case
distinction (`31 §2`) tells them apart at parse time. Names in `EVar`/`TVar`
are still surface names; `§5.3` replaces them with de Bruijn indices.

### 5.3 Name resolution → de Bruijn (the correctness-critical core)

This is the **one** pass where V0 can silently produce a *well-typed-looking but
wrong* core term: a capture or mis-scoping bug yields a term the kernel will
happily check — against the wrong binder. The kernel cannot catch it (it only
sees indices, which would resolve to *something*), so V0 must get it right. The
algorithm is the standard scope-stack walk:

```
resolve(scope, node):                  -- scope: name list, innermost first
  case node of
    EVar(name):
      i := indexOf(scope, name)         -- first (innermost) match, 0-based
      if i = none:  error Unbound(name, node.span)
      return RVar(i, name)              -- keep name for diagnostics only
    ELam(x, body):
      return RLam(x, resolve(push(x, scope), body))   -- single binder
    EApp(f, a):
      return RApp(resolve(scope, f), resolve(scope, a))
    EAsc(e, t):
      return RAsc(resolve(scope, e), resolveTy(scope, t))
    ECon(c):   return RCon(c)             -- base type as a term; resolved in Σ
    EUniv(l):  return RUniv(l)            -- Type / Type n as a term
    ELet(bindings, body):
      return resolveLetGroup(scope, ∅, bindings, body)

resolveLetGroup(scope, seen, bindings, body):
  case bindings of

```

**Desugaring to single binders.** Lambda and Π binder groups are flattened to
nested single-binder forms in a parse pre-pass, *before* resolution, so their
resolved AST (`RLam`, `RPi`) is uniformly single-binder:

- a λ over several names `\x y z . e` → `\x . \y . \z . e`;
- a binder group `(x y z : A)` → three Π/λ binders each of type `A`;
- a `view f (x : A) (y : B) : C = body` → nested λ over the parameter telescope
  with the declared type read as the matching nested Π `(x : A) → (y : B) → C`.

A local binding group is lowered during the scope walk instead: `b1; ...; bn`
becomes `RLet(b1, RLet(..., RLet(bn, body)))` in source order. Resolving before
each recursive step is load-bearing: earlier names enter scope for every later
annotation and RHS, while a binding cannot see itself or a later name. The
duplicate-name check runs over the source group before lexical shadowing could
make a repeated sibling appear to be an ordinary nested shadow. The resulting
resolved and core terms are structurally identical to the explicitly nested
single-binding spelling, modulo source spans.

Parameter binders thus enter the scope stack left-to-right (outermost first),
exactly as λ/Π binders do (`§5.4`). The output is a **resolved AST** (`RVar` /
`RVarTy` carry an index; binder sites retain the source name for error messages
only — the index is what elaboration emits).

**Properties this pass must have:**

1. **Shadowing is by stack discipline.** An inner binder of the same name hides
   an outer one because `indexOf` returns the *first* (innermost) match. No
   special shadowing logic is needed or permitted — getting this from the stack
   is what makes it correct.
2. **A binder scopes only where the grammar says.** In `(x : A) → B`, `x` is in
   scope in `B` but **not** in `A`. In a local binding group, `x_i` is absent
   from its own annotation and RHS, present in every later binding, and present
   in the body (there is no local recursion). The pseudocode pushes each binder
   on exactly the right recursive call.
3. **Unbound is a name-resolution error**, raised *here* with a source span
   (`§5.6`), never deferred to the kernel.

**Worked shadowing case** (the load-bearing guard — AC4). The guard must be
**discriminating**: correct resolution and a capture bug have to produce
*observably different* outcomes, or the test passes vacuously and catches
nothing (the discriminating-case discipline). A program whose body merely
*rejects* under both resolutions does **not** qualify — the verdict, or the
emitted index, has to differ. The right shape pairs a shadowing binder of a
**different type** than the intended one with a codomain the **intended**
binder satisfies:

```
view f (A : Type) (x : A) : Type -> A = \B . x
```

Its declared type is `(A : Type) → (x : A) → (Type → A)`, i.e.
`Pi(Univ 0, Pi(Var 0, Pi(Univ 0, Var 2)))`. Resolving the body `\B . x`, the
scope stack at the occurrence of `x` is (innermost first):

```
[ B ,  x ,  A ]      -- from \B , then the params (x : A)(A : Type)
  0    1    2
```

`indexOf(scope, "x")` skips `B` (name `B` ≠ `x`) and matches at **index 1** —
the outer `x` parameter (type `A`). The elaborated core is
`Lam(Univ 0, Lam(Var 0, Lam(Univ 0, Var 1)))`; checked against the declared
type, the body `x : A` meets the codomain `A` (`Var 2` under the three binders),
so it **kernel-accepts**. A capture bug that instead resolved `x` to the
innermost binder (**index 0** = `B : Type`) would emit `… Lam(Univ 0, Var 0)`,
whose body has type `Type ≢ A` — the kernel **rejects**. The two resolutions
give **opposite verdicts**, so the case genuinely exercises the resolver.

The discriminating signal is the **resolved index itself** (`Var 1`, not
`Var 0`); conformance asserts it **structurally** on the emitted core term —
verdict-independent, so the guard holds even where a kernel verdict alone would
be ambiguous (`§5.6`, AC4). (Contrast the tempting non-example
`… : (A : Type) → A = \A . x`: the inner λ shadows with the *same* name and
type-role as the codomain binder, so *both* the correct and the captured
resolution reject — the test would pass vacuously and guard nothing.) This case
is **required**, not optional: name resolution is the one V0 pass whose errors
the kernel cannot backstop — a mis-resolution that stayed well-typed would be a
silent, well-typed-but-wrong term (`§1`).

### 5.4 Elaboration — surface → core (the algorithm)

Elaboration is **bidirectional** (`§2.3`, `18 §3`): `check` pushes a known type
inward, `infer` synthesises one. It runs on the *resolved* AST (indices, not
names) and emits core terms (`11 §1`). V0's minimal forms keep it small: `infer`
for variables, applications, and ascriptions; `check` for λ and `let`; a single
`infer`-then-convert fallback everywhere else.

Both judgments below carry an implicit `owner_label: String`. An enclosing
named declaration supplies its derived label; a public standalone-expression
API requires its caller to supply a stable semantic audit owner explicitly.
Every recursive `infer`/`check` call preserves that context. The label is never
derived from the expression being checked.

```

    RUniv(Some n):  return Univ(n)                    -- Type n      (12 §1)

```

**`Axiom` is a checking-mode elaborator intercept, not a kernel term.** The
intercept runs before ordinary constructor lookup and requires the `expected`
type supplied by `check`; there is no corresponding inference rule. It calls
`declare_postulate` with that expected type. The kernel classifies the type and,
on success, admits a fresh typed, body-less opaque declaration; elaboration
returns only an ordinary constant reference to that declaration. An ill-formed
expected type is rejected by the ordinary declaration check. No `Axiom` node is
emitted into core syntax and no kernel judgment recognizes one.

Because the rule depends only on checking mode, `Axiom` is legal in every term
position that has an expected type, including an instance field or a nested
operand checked against a known parameter type. Its postulate label comes from
the current semantic owner (`18 §4.2`): either the enclosing named declaration
or the explicit caller of a public standalone-expression API. The public API's
owner argument is required and non-optional, so an ownerless call is
unrepresentable. The label is never inferred from the expression, source
position, module, allocation order, session counter, gensym, or a generic
sentinel such as `"standalone expression"` or `"test"`. The declaration sugar
`axiom N : T` is only
`theorem N : T = Axiom` (`32 §1`): it does not deprecate, remove, hoist, or
otherwise restrict expression-position `Axiom`. Multiple `Axiom` occurrences
within one semantic owner legitimately receive the same owner label while
`declare_postulate` gives each a distinct `GlobalId`.

Notes tying each clause to the kernel:

- **`Lam` carries its domain.** The core λ is `λ (x : A). t` (`11 §1`,
  `13 §1` Π-Intro); V0 takes the domain `A` from the *expected* Π, so the
  emitted λ and the Π agree by construction — there is no separate annotation to
  drift. This is why λ is a **`check`** form, never `infer` (an unannotated λ
  has no inferable domain in V0).
- **Application is `infer`.** The head's type is whnf-reduced (`17 §3.2`) to
  expose a Π; the argument is `check`ed against the domain; the result type is
  the codomain with the argument substituted, `B[a'/x]` (`13 §1` Π-Elim). V0
  never guesses the head type.
- **The mode switch is the only conversion call.** Every non-canonical `check`
  falls to `infer`-then-`convert` (`18 §3`), the algorithmic (Conv) rule. V0
  surfaces a `convert = false` as a `TypeMismatch` with the *surface* span
  (`§5.6`); it does **not** insert a `cast` (V0 has no `Eq` proofs to cast
  along — casts are a Phase-3/observational concern, `16`). Because the K1
  kernel's `convert` is total and decidable (`18 §3`, `17 §5`), the switch
  always returns a definite yes/no.
- **No unification across terms.** V0's only metavariables are **level** metas
  (`§5.7`); term-level inference is the explicit bidirectional walk above. This
  keeps V0 far simpler than the full elaborator (`§2.3`), which is licensed
  because V0's surface is explicit-enough that nothing else needs solving.

The emitted core term is **fully explicit**: de Bruijn indices, explicit domains
on every λ and Π, and explicit levels on every `Univ` (`§5.7`). It contains no
metavariables — V0 solves all level metas before emission — so the kernel
receives exactly the language of `11 §1`.

For a local binding group, `resolveLetGroup` has already produced the existing
nested `RLet` chain. The `RLet` clause above therefore elaborates `b_1` under
the incoming context, extends that context for `b_2`, and continues
left-to-right until it checks the body under every group binding. It emits the
same ordered nest of existing core `Let` terms as the explicitly nested surface
spelling. There is no grouped core term, new conversion rule, recursion
mechanism, or trusted-base entry.

### 5.5 The pipeline

V0 is a straight-line pipeline from source text to a kernel verdict; the kernel
is the sole judge and is never bypassed.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  src["surface text"] --> lex["lex (31 §8)"]
  lex --> parse["parse (32 §8)"]
  parse --> sast["surface AST"]
  sast --> res["resolve names (5.3)"]
  res --> rast["resolved AST (de Bruijn)"]
  rast --> elab["elaborate (5.4)"]
  elab --> core["core Term (11)"]
  core --> kern["kernel check / infer (18 §3)"]
  kern --> ok["Ok rechecked term"]
  kern --> err["Err diagnostic"]
```

Each stage can fail and is the origin of one error class (`§5.6`): the lexer and
parser raise **parse errors**; resolution raises **unbound-name errors**;
elaboration raises **lambda-vs-non-function** and surfaces the kernel's
**type-mismatch**. The accepted output is **always** a core term that the
kernel's `infer`/`check` (`18 §3`) has re-derived a type for — V0 emits the
term and reports the kernel's verdict; it has no acceptance path of its own.

### 5.6 Errors

V0 produces three error classes, each tagged with a source span and attributed
to the stage that raised it (`§4` — these are L1 surface errors, distinct from
L2 verification failures):

- **Parse error** — from the lexer/parser (`31 §8`/`32 §8`), with the span of
  the offending token or region.
- **Unbound name** — from name resolution (`§5.3`), naming the unresolved
  identifier with its span. Raised *here*, never deferred to the kernel (an
  unbound name has no de Bruijn index to emit).
- **Type mismatch** — from the kernel's `convert`/`infer` failing on the emitted
  core term (`18 §3`, `17 §3.3`), re-surfaced at the originating *surface* span
  with the expected and inferred types. Includes `NotAFunction` (a non-Π head in
  application) and `LambdaVsNonFunction` (a λ checked against a non-Π), which V0
  detects structurally before the kernel call.

V0 SHOULD recover and report multiple errors where it can (parse and
name-resolution errors compose across independent declarations; the LSP wants
this, `§4`), but its **accepted** output is always kernel-checked — a program
with a type error has no well-typed core image and is rejected, never partially
admitted (`§3`).

### 5.7 Level-discipline reconcile

Per the standing directive, every formation rule in `§5.4` that produces or
manipulates a universe level is given its **explicit** level computation and
reconciled against `10-kernel/12-universes.md` — citing the section, not merely
deferring to it.

- **Universe (`elabType` `RUniv`).** `Type n` elaborates to `Univ(n)`, and the
  kernel types it by `Univ(n) : Univ(suc n)` — the **(U-Type)** rule, `12 §1`.
  There is **no** `Type n : Type n` and no `Type : Type` (Girard's paradox,
  `12 §1`); V0 emits a concrete `n`, so the kernel checks the literal rule. A
  **bare** `Type` elaborates to `Univ(?u)` for a fresh level metavariable `?u`
  (`§5.4`); `?u` is solved during elaboration (below) and the emitted core has
  an explicit level — the kernel **never** receives a level metavariable
  (`12 §4`).

- **Dependent function type (`elabType` `RPi`/`RArr`).** `(x : A) → B`
  elaborates to `Pi(A', B')`; the kernel types it by the predicative
  **(Π-Form)** rule, `13 §1` / `12 §2`:

  ```
    Γ ⊢ A' : Type ℓ₁     Γ, x : A' ⊢ B' : Type ℓ₂
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────
    Γ ⊢ (x : A') → B' : Type (max ℓ₁ ℓ₂)
  ```

  The function type takes the **`max`** of domain and codomain levels and does
  **not** drop to a lower universe (predicativity, `12 §2`) — V0 stores no level
  on the `Pi` node (it is derived by the kernel), so there is nothing for V0 to
  get wrong here *except* not inventing a level: V0 emits `Pi(A', B')` and lets
  (Π-Form) compute `max`. For the trivial `id`, `(A : Type 0) → (x : A) → A` has
  level `max(suc 0, max 0 0) = 1` by (Π-Form) over the two nested Πs — `Type`
  itself sits at `Type 1`, its element `A` at `Type 0`.

- **Non-cumulative (`OQ-2`, `12 §3`).** `A : Type ℓ` does **not** give
  `A : Type (suc ℓ)`; lifting is **explicit**. V0 inserts **no** implicit lifts
  and has no subtyping — a "universe too low" mismatch is surfaced as a
  `TypeMismatch` (`§5.6`), not silently coerced. (Cumulative ergonomics are a
  later untrusted-elaborator concern, `12 §3`; V0 does not pay that cost and the
  kernel never sees a subtyping query.)

- **Level metavariable solving.** V0's only metavariables are levels. Solving is
  a semilattice unification over `ℓ ::= 0 | suc ℓ | max ℓ ℓ | ?u` (`12 §1`):
  constraints arise where two universes must agree (e.g. an ascription forcing
  two `Type`s equal). An **unconstrained** `?u` is defaulted to `0` — *typical
  ambiguity*, the one declared level default (`12 §4`, `§3`). After solving, V0
  emits the explicit level; the kernel re-checks each level equality as an
  ordinary decidable level conversion (`12 §1`, `17 §3.6`) at every use, so a
  wrong solve is caught by the kernel, not trusted. Level abstraction is only at
  top-level declarations (`12 §4`); V0 emits explicit level arguments on any
  polymorphic-constant use and never makes a level a first-class term.

- **Decidable level equality.** Level comparison during the mode switch and at
  every `Univ` is the kernel's `convLevel` (`17 §3.6`) over the semilattice laws
  (`max` associative/commutative/idempotent, `max ℓ 0 = ℓ`, `suc (max ℓ₁ ℓ₂) =
  max (suc ℓ₁) (suc ℓ₂)`, `12 §1`). It is total and decidable, so the level
  side of conversion never stalls — consistent with the K1 kernel contract
  (`18 §3`).

This reconcile confirms V0's level computations are exactly those of `12`:
universes step by `suc`, function types take the predicative `max`, lifting is
never implicit, unconstrained levels default to `0`, and every level reaching
the kernel is explicit and decidably checked.

### 6.0 Class-field purity metadata (SURF-2)

Class-field purity is an additive surface/elaboration check over the `33 §5.2`
class-record shape. It is not a second class system and not a kernel feature.

**Parse/store.** The class field grammar is:

```
class_field ::= field_purity? field_name ":" type
field_purity ::= "const" | "fn" | "proc"
```

The parser stores the optional keyword with the field declaration, e.g.
`Decl::ClassDecl.fields` becomes declaration-order triples
`(Option<DefKeyword>, field_name, field_type)` or an equivalent field record.
`None` means the field is unmarked and keeps the pre-SURF-2 behaviour.

During `elab_class_decl`, the elaborator registers the keyword as class metadata
parallel to the existing field vectors:

```
ClassInfo {
  field_names    : Vec<String>,
  field_types    : Vec<Term>,
  field_purities : Vec<Option<DefKeyword>>,
  ...
}
```

`field_types` remains the only input to the emitted right-nested Σ telescope and
to the kernel-computed class sort (`33 §5.1`). `field_purities` is erased before
kernel emission: it must not affect the class type, the Σ chain, `sort_sigma`,
property-vs-structure classification, orphan/overlap policy, or
`trusted_base()`.

**Class-field marker validation.** A marked class field is validated at class
declaration time against the field's declared type/telescope, before any
instance exists. The classifier input is the field signature read from
`field_types[i]`, not an implementation expression and not a hidden field-binder
list. Thus `const seed : Int` and `fn unary : Int -> Int` are well-shaped pure
fields; `const bad : Int -> Int`, `fn bad : Int`, and `proc bad : A -> A`
reject unless the declared type itself carries the effect/row-polymorphic shape
that earns `proc`. The `proc traverse` field in `56 §5.1` is the intended
positive case: its declared telescope is row-polymorphic through the abstract
applicative argument, so the stored marker is earned by the field signature.

**Instance-field enforcement.** Instance elaboration still computes field values
in class-declaration order and checks each implementation against its
properly-substituted expected type (`compute_ordered_field_values`, `33 §5.3`).
For a marked field, the same step also checks that the field implementation is
compatible with the already-stored field classification, reusing the existing
SURF-1 static-purity classifier/check (`36 §1.6`):

- `None` — status quo: no purity check beyond the existing type check.
- `Some(Const)` / `Some(Fn)` — the implementation must classify as pure with
  the corresponding explicit-value-arity rule; false-purity/effect escape is a
  hard L1 error.
- `Some(Proc)` — the implementation must classify as `proc` by the existing
  SURF-1 criteria, including the row-variable/effect-polymorphic case. A
  best-case pure instantiation does not downgrade the field; the declared field
  signature is what is checked.

This check is a factorization/reuse of the definition-level
`check_surface_purity` path, not a parallel classifier. A mismatch is reported
at the instance field span with the declared class field and expected keyword in
the diagnostic; it is not deferred to the kernel.

**Projection classification.** `.field` projection continues to elaborate to
the same Σ projection term (`proj1(proj2^i(d))`) with the same substituted field
type. In addition, when the base is a known class dictionary, `infer_proj`
consults `ClassInfo::field_purities[i]` and attaches that static-purity
classification to the projected expression. Therefore, if
`Traversable.traverse` is declared `proc`, a use such as `d.traverse` classifies
as `proc` at the call site and routes through the ordinary effect/purity checks.
Unmarked projections remain unclassified.

**Build extension points.** The minimal implementation surface is exactly the
existing class path: the parser's class-field loop accepts an optional
`DefKeyword`; the class AST carries it; `ClassInfo` stores it parallel to
`field_names`; the instance Σ-Intro field check enforces it through the SURF-1
purity path; and `RExpr::RProj`/`infer_proj` returns the projection's stored
field purity to downstream classification. No `crates/ken-kernel` or
`Cargo.lock` change is in scope.

### 6.1 The instance environment (built from declarations)

Resolution reads an **instance environment** the elaborator accumulates as it
processes `instance` declarations (`33 §5.3`). Each accepted instance registers
one entry:

- **key** — `(class C, head-type h)`, where `h` is the **outermost type
  constructor** of the instance's head (`head(List a) = List`, `head(Int) =
  Int`); the arguments under `h` are matched at resolution.
- **value** — the instance record value (or, for a **parameterised** instance
  `instance C (F ā) where C Gᵢ ...`, the **dictionary-builder** — a function
  from the sub-constraint dictionaries to the `C (F ā)` record, §6.4).
- **registration is gated** by the **orphan check** (`33 §5.3`) and the
  **overlap check**: registering a second entry under an existing
  `(C, h)` key for a **structure** class is the overlap error (§6.7), caught at
  declaration. Property (Ω) classes are never keyed for canonicity — they need
  no registry beyond "an instance exists."

### 6.2 The search procedure

Discharging an inserted implicit `{d : C A}` (`33 §5.4`) runs `resolve`:

```
resolve(Γ, C, A) → Term:                       -- returns the dictionary for  C A
  s := sortOf(Γ, recordType(C, A))             -- the class record's KERNEL sort (33 §5.1)
  h := head(A)                                  -- outermost type constructor of A
  case s of
    Omega:                                       -- PROPERTY class — coherence is free
      d := anyRegisteredInstance(C)              -- all instances defeq (16 §1); first found
        or error NoInstance(C, A, span)
      return d                                    -- never ambiguous: any instance does
    Type:                                         -- STRUCTURE class — canonical convention
      case lookupAll(instanceEnv, C, h) of
        []        -> error NoInstance(C, A, span)             -- 33 §5.5 / §6.7
        [inst]    -> dischargeSubConstraints(Γ, inst, A)       -- recurse (§6.4), then build
        c₁,c₂,… -> error AmbiguousInstance(C, A, [span c₁, span c₂, …])
                    -- names ALL viable candidates; NEVER a silent pick (AC3)
```

- **The sort is the switch (`AC4`).** `resolve` consults the **kernel-computed
  sort** of the class record (`33 §5.1`), not a flag: `Ω` ⇒ property branch
  (any instance), `Type` ⇒ structure branch (canonical). A single procedure
  serves both kinds; the discriminant is structural.
- **Determinism + no guessing (`§3`).** For a structure class the `(C, h)` key
  admits **at most one** registered entry (overlap is rejected at declaration,
  §6.1); the lookup is therefore a function. Two viable candidates surfacing at
  search time (e.g. via a genuinely ambiguous head) is the **ambiguity error
  naming both** — never a default. `resolve` inserts a `d.opᵢ` **projection**
  (`13 §2`) for each class-operation use in the body.
- **Coherence (`AC1`).** Because the key is `(C, head(A))` and the registry has
  one canonical entry per key, the **same** `(class, head-type)` resolves to the
  **same** instance at every site — "the `Ord A`" is a function of `A`,
  program-wide, the property the law-carrying prover relies on (ADR 0008).

### 6.3 Sub-constraints and the built dictionary

A parameterised instance carries its own constraints:

```
instance Ord (List a) where Ord a { … }     -- needs an  Ord a  to build  Ord (List a)
```

`dischargeSubConstraints` resolves each sub-constraint (`Ord a`) **recursively**
via `resolve`, then applies the instance's builder to the found
sub-dictionaries, yielding the `Ord (List a)` record value. The recursion is
what §6.4 must bound.

### 6.4 Termination — the landed SCT on the reified dictionary group

Instance search terminates by the **existing** size-change checker
(`../10-kernel/17 §4`), **not** a second termination mechanism. A parameterised
instance's builder (`mkOrdList : {a} → Ord a → Ord (List a)`) is *itself*
non-recursive — it takes its sub-dictionary as a parameter — so the recursion
that must be bounded is the **resolution's**, and the reuse is literal via
reifying that resolution:

- **Reify the resolution as a dictionary-definition group.** Discharging a goal
  `C A` that needs sub-goals `C Gᵢ` emits one δ-definition per **distinct**
  `(class, type)` sub-goal reached — `d⟦C A⟧ := mkInst (d⟦C G₁⟧) …` — admitted
  through the real `declare_def` / **`declare_recursive_group`**
  (`check.rs:983`, `sct_check` at `:1033`). The edges of this group are exactly
  the instance-dependency graph.
- **Bound by the landed `sct_check`.** `declare_recursive_group` runs
  **`sct_check`** on that group at **admission time**, under the **structural
  subterm order**
  (`17 §4.2`) keyed on each node's **head-type**: a sub-goal's head-type (`a`,
  `Gᵢ`) is a **strict structural subterm** of its parent's (`List a`, `F ā`). A
  **well-founded** instance chain (`Ord a ⇒ Ord (List a)`: `a ⊏ List a`) yields
  a group that either bottoms out or strictly descends — **`sct_check` accepts**
  (`AC6`-accept). A **cyclic / non-decreasing** set (`instance C A where C A`,
  or `C a ⇒ C (F a)` with `F` non-decreasing) yields a node that transitively
  **references itself with no head-type decrease** — a recursive group
  `sct_check` **rejects** (`AC6`-reject) — a **declaration/admission-time**
  error with a non-termination diagnostic, *never a search-time hang*.
- **Why this is not a second checker.** The reified resolution *is* a
  δ-recursive definition group; the kernel already bounds those. Termination is
  decided by
  the **real landed `sct_check`** — the producer-grep target for `AC6` is that
  path (`check.rs`), not a bespoke instance-graph traversal. The elaborator's
  search additionally maintains the goal stack and can short-circuit a
  non-decreasing step for a faster diagnostic (the same `17 §4.2` metric), but
  the **authoritative** bound is the kernel SCT on the reified group — the two
  agree by construction.
- **Reification faithfulness (NORMATIVE — the load-bearing requirement).** The
  SCT bound is sound **only if** the reified group's δ-recursion **mirrors the
  actual resolution recursion** — one node per distinct sub-goal, one edge per
  `dischargeSubConstraints` call (§6.3), the head-type carried per node. A
  reified group that dropped an edge (or keyed a node on anything but the
  resolution sub-goal) would make `sct_check` bound the **wrong** recursion, so
  a non-terminating search could slip an accepting SCT verdict. The build MUST
  emit the group as the exact image of the resolution graph; **`AC6` is
  discriminating on this** — the non-terminating case must reach reject **via
  `sct_check` on the real reified group** (grep the producer), not via an
  elaborator-side proxy that could diverge from what the kernel checks.

### 6.5 Named-instance explicit passing (bypasses search)

A named instance value `byLength : Ord String` (an ordinary `let`/`view` of
record type, `33 §5.5`) is passed by **making the implicit explicit** at the
call site — the surface `f {d = byLength} x` / positional dictionary application
(grammar `32`, the implicit-as-explicit form). Elaboration binds `d := byLength`
**directly**, so `resolve` is **not called** for that argument. Explicit passing
therefore **cannot perturb** implicit canonicity (§6.2): at the same type, an
*implicit* `where Ord String` still runs `resolve` and selects the **canonical**
`Ord String` (`AC5`). Explicit and implicit are distinct code paths — one is
value application, the other is search.

### 6.6 `derive` — generate a candidate, let the kernel re-check

`derive (DecEq, Show)` (`33 §5.6`) runs a **generator** per derivable class:

```
deriveInstance(C, dataDecl D) → instance candidate:
  build the operation bodies by structural recursion over D's constructors
    (e.g. DecEq: eq (Cᵢ x̄) (Cⱼ ȳ) = i==j && ⋀ eq xₖ yₖ ; Show similarly)
  build the law proofs (e.g. DecEq.ok) by the same structural recursion
  assemble the record value  (op̄ , law̄) : C D
  emit it through declare_def  ── the KERNEL re-checks ops AND proofs
```

Generation is **untrusted**: the candidate is admitted by the **real
`declare_def`** (§6.4's path), so a malformed generated instance — a wrong
op body, an unprovable law — **fails the kernel check**, not a soft elaborator
gate (`AC7`, soundness). **Producer-grep:** the derive path MUST emit its
candidate through `declare_def`/kernel-check; a test that *inserts a ready-made
dictionary* and re-checks a downstream consumer is green-vs-green (it re-tests
the consumer, not derivation). Derivable classes are a fixed structural list;
a non-structural class is not derivable (`33 §5.6`).

### 6.7 Diagnostics (T1-protocol, with spans)

Each resolution failure is an **L1 surface error** (`§4`) carried on the
**T1 agent protocol** (`../20-verification/25`) with source spans:

| Diagnostic | Raised when | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| **`OrphanInstance`** | an `instance C T` names neither `C` nor `T` in its module (`33 §5.3`) | the instance decl span; the class + head-type |
| **`OverlappingInstances`** | a second instance registers under an existing `(C, h)` structure key (§6.1) | **both** instance decl spans |
| **`AmbiguousInstance`** | search finds ≥2 viable candidates for a structure goal (§6.2) | the use-site span; **all** candidate spans |
| **`NoInstance`** | no registered instance for `(C, head(A))` | the use-site span; the wanted `C A` |
| **`NonTerminatingInstances`** | the reified dictionary group fails `sct_check` (§6.4) | the offending instance span; the non-decreasing cycle |

Never a silent pick and never a hang: ambiguity and non-termination are
**reported**, per `§3` (no guessing past ambiguity) and ADR 0008.

### 6.8 Landed vs. net-new (producer-grep honesty)

All of `class`/`instance`/`where`/`derive` — surface, AST, parser, the instance
environment, and the search — is **net-new** (no landed producer today; the
conformance suite drives the code the Lc build creates, grepping it is the real
elaborator path, not a synthetic "class" literal). The **soundness-critical**
ACs bottom out in **landed** producers: `AC7` (`derive`) and every instance
ride the real **`declare_def`** re-check (`check.rs`); `AC6` (termination) is
the real
**`sct_check`** on the reified dictionary group (§6.4); the record/Σ
encoding targets the landed **`Term::Sigma`/`Pair`/`Proj`** (`13 §2`); and
property-class coherence is the landed **Ω-PI** (`16 §1`). The net-new logic is
the *desugaring, the orphan/overlap check, and the search*; the *trust root it
rests on is landed and unchanged* — subsume-don't-proliferate.

## 7. What WS-L/WS-V must deliver here (V0, then L-stream)

The elaborator: scope resolution, implicit insertion, bidirectional HM+dependent
inference with unification up to conversion, level inference, instance
resolution, `match`→`elim_D` with exhaustiveness, full sugar expansion, and
obligation emission — all producing kernel-checked core, with stable surface
diagnostics. Proof-returning dependent `match` motives add the focused
`34 §3.5`/`§2.1` seed: a positive `Ω`-target case and a wrong-specialized-branch
negative that classify any Type-vs-Omega whole-body rejection to a named layer.
**V0** delivers the minimal slice (G1); the rest grows with the
surface. **Instance resolution (§6)** is the **Lc** slice — the search
algorithm, its landed-SCT termination, and the T1 diagnostics. Conformance:
`../../conformance/surface/elaboration/` — well-typed-output invariant (every
accepted program's core image checks), ambiguity-is-an-error cases, and
`match`-exhaustiveness compilation; `../../conformance/surface/classes/` — the
Lc suite (`33 §5` + §6): coherence, orphan/overlap, property-vs-structure by
sort, named-explicit escape, SCT termination, `derive`-kernel-checked, and the
prover-citable law field.
