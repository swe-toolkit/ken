# The surface language

The surface is the language a programmer or agent actually writes. It is also
the **self-hosting substrate** (strategy WS-L), so it is core, not a late skin.
It elaborates (`39-elaboration.md`) to the kernel core (`../10-kernel/`); the
surface adds ergonomics (implicit arguments, inference, sugar, modules), never
new trusted semantics.

The **built-in / prelude / standard-package taxonomy** — what must be
primitively provided (the surface TCB) versus what is ordinary re-checked Ken —
is fixed in **`30-taxonomy.md`**, with the minimality invariant *surface
built-in set ≡ `trusted_base()` delta*. It is the organizing line for this
section: `35`/`37` supply the built-in types + primitives, and
`../50-stdlib/README.md` is the reframed standard-package catalog (the dissolved
L8).

## 1. Design stance

- **Vocabulary is Ken's own.** The effect and module forms follow
  category-faithful shapes proven in practice; the names and code are Ken's.
- **Sum types are real from day one.** Sum types lower to genuine inductive
  families with real constructors and eliminators — the single most important
  thing to get right. Ken has **real** sum types, `match`, and exhaustiveness
  from day one (`34-data-match.md`).
- **`Int` from day one.** Ken has `Int`, `Decimal`, and an honestly-named
  `Float` (`35-numbers.md`); numeric types are exact and distinct, never a
  single type lowered to `f64`.
- **Verification is in the surface, not bolted on.** `requires`/`ensures`,
  refinement types, and `prove` (`../20-verification/21-spec-syntax.md`) are
  first-class surface forms.
- **Concrete syntax is OQ except where explicitly pinned.** The forms below are
  a coherent proposal; bikeshed (keywords, layout vs. braces, and unpinned
  operator spellings) is deferred, not load-bearing. Chapters `31`/`32` mark
  the exact six-name reserved-infix admission as contract-pinned.

## 2. Core vocabulary (proposal)

| Concept | Surface form | Elaborates to |
|---|---|---|
| Pure function (a morphism) | `view f (x : A) : B = …` | Π + λ (`13`) |
| Definition (alias / refinement) | `def T = …` / `{ x:A | φ }` | core type / Σ (`12 §5`, `34`) |
| Record (product) | `record R { f : A, … }` | right-nested Σ with η (`13 §3`) |
| Sum / inductive | `data D = C1 … | C2 …` | inductive family (`14`) |
| Pattern match | `match e { … }` | `elim_D` (`14 §3`, `39`) |
| Definition / value | `let x : A = e` | global/local def (`11 §4`) |
| Proposition / spec | `prop`/`theorem`/`proof`/`prove`/`law` | Ω terms + obligations (`20`) |
| Effectful function | `view f (…) visits [E] = …` | effect-rowed type (`36`) |
| Module | `module M { … }` / `import` | namespaced env (`33`) |
| Stateful region | `space S { … }` | the state/effect model (`36`, OQ-Space DECIDED) |

## 3. Chapter map

| File | Subject |
|---|---|
| `31-lexical.md` | Tokens, identifiers, literals, comments, layout |
| `32-grammar.md` | The concrete grammar (declarations, types, expressions, patterns) |
| `33-declarations.md` | Modules, imports, definitions, records, visibility, typeclasses-as-subobjects |
| `34-data-match.md` | Sum types, constructors, `match`, exhaustiveness, `Result`/`Option`, refinements |
| `35-numbers.md` | `Int`/`Decimal`/`Float` — Ken's exact numeric model in full |
| `36-effects.md` | Effect tracking (`visits`), capabilities, the state/`space` model |
| `37-strings-collections.md` | `String`, `List`, `Map`, `Set`, iteration |
| `38-ffi-io.md` | `Bytes`, binary I/O, the FFI surface |
| `39-elaboration.md` | Surface → core: implicits, inference, sugar expansion |

## 4. What the surface must deliver (WS-L, ties to G6)

Real types (`Int`, sum types, `Bytes`), `match` + exhaustiveness, modules + a
package manager, an effect system, FFI, and a curated stdlib — enough to write
one realistic verified component end-to-end (G6) and, eventually, to host a
compiler (self-hosting prerequisite). The verification surface (`../20-`) rides
on top. Conformance for surface behavior: `../../conformance/surface/`.
