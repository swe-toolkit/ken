## 1. `Bytes` and binary I/O

`Bytes` is an **immutable, finite byte sequence** — the substrate for binary
protocols, hashing, serialization, and (in L7) FFI buffers. At the world
boundary, `read_bytes` reads bytes from files and `print_line` writes text to
the console. Every such operation is **effect-tracked** (`36`): an I/O
operation that does not carry its effect row is a **type error**. Text is
**never** an implicit reinterpretation of bytes — a
`String` is obtained from `Bytes` only through an **explicit, named**
`bytes_encode`/`bytes_decode` step (no hidden charset). Over that substrate sits
a **lawful serialization round-trip** (`§1.5`), the verified-component target
for G6.

### 1.1 The `Bytes` primitive

`Bytes` is a **primitive type** in the `14 §5` sense — an **opaque type
constant** with **no kernel-level constructors or eliminator**; it adds **no new
kernel rule** (guardrail). Its inhabitants are **literals** (introduced by the
elaborator as opaque primitive values) and the results of the primitive
operations (`§1.2`). This is the same discipline as the L1 numeric primitives
(`35`): the kernel gains an opaque constant plus a small, **audited** set of
registered operation symbols, listed in the trusted-base ledger (`18 §5`).

- **Immutable and finite.** A `Bytes` value never changes after construction;
  there is **no mutating operation** in the surface (the AC1 structural
  property). "Updating" bytes (for example, `slice` or `concat`) returns a value
  without changing either input. Allocation, copying, and sharing are private
  runtime choices (`41 §2`).
- **Durable encoding and private runtime representation (landed `41`).** The
  canonical encoding (`41 §3a`) is the **kind tag `0x05`** followed by the raw
  byte sequence (length-determined). Two `Bytes` values with identical content
  encode identically and compare equal. Their in-process addressing, storage,
  and equality acceleration are private; they are distinct from the
  cryptographic/Merkle hash used for serialization (`§1.5`).
- **The `(ptr, len)` boundary.** A `Bytes` value's machine face is a
  `(pointer, length)` pair (`38 §2` marshalling, `41 §1`). L6 keeps this
  boundary clean and explicit so **L7's** `foreign` marshalling (`Bytes` ↔ a C
  buffer) rides it without rework — but L6 builds **no** `foreign` mechanism.

**Literals (`31 §3`).** Two surface forms denote `Bytes`:

| Form | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **byte string** | `b"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n"` | a byte sequence from a string-like body with escapes (each `\xNN`/ASCII char ⇒ one byte) |
| **hex** | `0x[deadbeef]` | the bytes spelled as hex nibble pairs (here `de`, `ad`, `be`, `ef`) |

The **bracketed** `0x[…]` is the `Bytes` form; the **un-bracketed** `0xFF` is an
**`Int`** literal (`31 §3`, `35`) — the two are different tokens with different
types and must not be conflated. A `b"…"` literal elaborates **directly** to the
`Bytes` primitive (AC1), not via `String` (no decode round-trip at the literal).

The `0x[…]` body is a **contiguous** run of an even number of ASCII hexadecimal
digits, lexed as consecutive nibble pairs; it admits **no internal whitespace or
separator**. `0x[de ad]` is a lexical error, not a spelling of `0x[dead]`. The
groupings that appear as reading aids — the nibble-pair gloss above, and any
spaced `0x[…]` in a doc comment — name the byte boundaries; they are never legal
source. (Readability grouping in Ken's literals is the underscore
digit separator, `31 §3`; if grouping in `0x[…]` is ever wanted it follows that
convention, not whitespace, and is a separate additive decision.)

### 1.2 Core `Bytes` operations (primitive / prelude)

The core operations are primitive operations with registered
`PrimReduction::Op` symbols (`14 §5`). The interpreter evaluates them over
`Bytes` values at runtime, so `bytes_length 0x[deadbeef]` produces `4` as a
value. The landed kernel does not execute an `Op` during conversion:
`bytes_length 0x[deadbeef] ≡ 4 : Int` is **not** definitional and the equation
does not close by `Refl`. An `Op` remains neutral to conversion even when its
arguments are literals. Kernel conversion of registered operations is
K3-deferred; these declarations add no landed kernel reduction rule.

| Op | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `length` | `Bytes → Int` | byte count; total, non-negative |
| `bytes_at` | `Bytes → Int → Option UInt8` | indexed byte; **partial** (invalid index ⇒ `None`) |
| `bytes_slice` | `Bytes → Int(start) → Int(len) → Option Bytes` | `None` on an invalid span |
| `concat` | `Bytes → Bytes → Bytes` | total; `++` on `Bytes` |
| `empty` | `Bytes` | the zero-length value; `length empty ≡ 0` |

- **Partiality follows the `35 §3` / `43 §2` discipline.** Indexing and slicing
  are the **partial** operations (bounds), handled the same way `35` handles
  `div`/`mod` by zero. `bytes_at b i` returns `None` when `i` is negative or
  outside `b`. `bytes_slice b start len` returns `None` when `start` or `len`
  is negative, or when that span extends past `b`; its third argument is a
  **length**, not an end offset. Neither operation returns a neutral or a
  fabricated byte/empty slice for invalid bounds. For verified code, an
  **obligation-generating** total form over a refinement (`at_pf : (b : Bytes)
  → (i : Int) → { i ≥ 0 ∧ i < length b } → UInt8`, `34 §5`) is proven in-range
  ⇒ total and safe; unproven ⇒ a marked partial point that degrades to a runtime
  check (`unknown`/panic), **never** a silent out-of-bounds read. The two faces
  are the §`35 §3` "checked is the runtime face of an undischarged obligation,"
  not a separate mode.
- **A byte is `UInt8`** (`35`); `length`/indices are `Int` (the default integer,
  arbitrary-precision, `35 §2`).
- **Non-definitional laws are propositions** (`14 §5`), not assumed:
  `length (concat a b) == length a + length b`, `concat`-associativity,
  `concat a empty == a`, etc. — proved in the prelude (`50-stdlib/`,
  `20-verification/`), not baked into the kernel.
- **Exact surface spellings.** The primitive names `bytes_at` and
  `bytes_slice`, their signatures, their total failure behavior, and their
  registered runtime semantics over values are fixed here. Spellings of the
  remaining prelude conveniences (`++` vs `concat`, for example) remain a
  **`31`/prelude naming** detail (oracle-tagged for the build team).

### 1.3 Effect-tracked I/O

Every I/O operation carries its **exact effect row** (`visits`, `36 §1`). The
two landed, ordinary surface witnesses used by this clause are:

| Landed operation | Mandatory row |
|---|---|
| `read_bytes` | `visits [FS]` |
| `print_line` | `visits [Console]` |

Their complete result and capability types are defined by the landed FS and
Console floors; this clause fixes the operation-to-row association. Ken has no
landed `Net` operation in this round. A `Net`-specific operation-binding witness
is deferred until a real `Net` producer lands; conformance must not synthesize
one merely to preserve an old oracle.

- **The no-untracked-I/O guard is the `36 §1.4` escape check — L6 introduces no
  new gate.** Each I/O operation is a `perform_E` site (`36 §1.2`): it is the
  **one** place its label (`FS`/`Console`) enters the inferred row. A call to an
  I/O operation from a context whose declared row does **not** contain that label is
  an **EFFECT-ESCAPE static error** (`ρ_inf ⊄ ρ_decl`). Pure-by-default ⇒ a
  `view` with **no** `visits` has `ρ_decl = ∅`, so **any** I/O call escapes ⇒
  **untracked I/O is a compile error** (AC2/AC3). The accepting case carries the
  effect in its row; the rejecting case drops it — a **verdict flip**, exercised
  with the **≥2 distinct effects** `FS` and `Console` (`36 §1.4`).
- **Every I/O act is a `Vis` node (`36 §3.1` contract).** The I/O operations are
  the tree's `perform` sites: a function's effects are recoverable from its
  **type** (the latent row `A →[ρ] B`), never hidden between nodes. This is the
  interface Sec/B (`60-`/`70-`) read labels and capabilities off of — L6 must
  not perforate it (no effectful I/O that bypasses a `Vis` node).
- **I/O operations are not kernel primitives.** Unlike the **pure** `Bytes` ops
  (`§1.2`, which carry registered interpreter dispatch), an I/O operation is an
  **effect-performing surface operation** whose
  denotation is an `ITree` `Vis` node (`36 §2`), **not** a kernel reduction — it
  computes no literal in the kernel and adds **nothing** to the TCB. The kernel
  admission this denotation needs (W-style recursive inductives) **landed in
  K1.5** (banner + `14 §8.4`).
- **Capabilities (`36 §3`) are the authority face of the same row.** An I/O
  operation may additionally take a capability token (`using c : Cap FS`) to
  express least authority; L6 specifies the **effect-row** obligation (the
  type-error-if-untracked guarantee) and leaves capability *threading* as the
  `36 §3` mechanism it already is — no new machinery here.

#### 1.3.1 Typed FS capability API

Programs use a typed capability API over the unchanged, authority-polymorphic
FS producers. The coarse-v1 signatures are:

```ken
readFile : (a : Auth) -> Cap a -> Bytes -> FS a (Result FileError Bytes)

writeFile : Cap AFull -> Bytes -> CreatePolicy -> Bytes
  -> FS AFull (Result FileError Unit)
```

`readFile` wraps `read_bytes`; `writeFile` wraps `write_file`. The wrappers do
not re-type or replace those raw producers. A read-and-write program calls
`readFile fullCap path` directly: the read wrapper accepts the authority carried
by any `Cap a`, including `ANone`, `APartial`, and `AFull`. The driver checks
read sufficiency at operation time; insufficient authority returns the named
`CapabilityDenied` result before host I/O. A static lower bound on `a` would
require bounded authority quantification, which v1 does not provide; that is a
v2 option rather than an implied v1 guarantee.

The write boundary remains static: a program holding only `Cap APartial` cannot
apply `writeFile`, so the attempt is ill-typed before the driver runs. The
driver's `CapabilityDenied` result remains defense in depth for writes and is
the primary authority floor for reads. User code has no public capability
constructor, capability-producing wrapper, Ken-callable attenuation function,
or Ken-callable revocation function. In particular, `readFile` and `writeFile`
are bound while the raw management names `attenuate` and `revoke` both resolve
as `UnboundName`, and no `Cap` constructor or producer is present in the Ken
environment. The wrappers are ordinary checked Ken definitions and add neither
a kernel rule nor a trusted primitive.

Raw attenuation and revocation are trusted runner/host management actions over
non-Ken-visible grant identities (`62 §4`), not source operations. Attenuation
records child lineage; revocation closes the selected identity and its
descendants. A program observes neither action directly. It observes revocation
only when a later existing capability-consuming operation returns one of these
exact type-local projections:

- a path/capability operation returns
  `MkFileError <operation> <path> Revoked`, where `Revoked` is a new `IOError`
  cause beside and distinct from `CapabilityDenied`;
- a resource-token operation returns the nullary constructor
  `ResourceError.Revoked`.

The two enclosing error families remain distinct; no shared sum is introduced.
The runtime/host mapping preserves their common semantic meaning and never maps
either to `CapabilityDenied`, `ResourceHostIO CapabilityDenied`, `Closed`,
malformed capability/resource, stale-generation, `RightNotHeld`,
`ResourceKindMismatch`, `ResourceHostIO _`, or another host I/O failure.

### 1.4 Text is explicit `bytes_encode` / `bytes_decode` — no hidden charset

A `String` is obtained from `Bytes` **only** through a named, visible boundary;
there is **no** implicit charset reinterpretation anywhere in the surface
(AC4).

```
bytes_encode : String → Bytes
bytes_decode : Bytes → Result Utf8Error String
```

- **`bytes_encode` is total and UTF-8 by contract.** It serializes a `String`
  (which is **NFC-normalized UTF-8** by construction, `41 §3a`) to its UTF-8
  bytes. The **charset is named in the operation**, not hidden: a non-UTF-8
  codec (if ever added) is a **different named function** (`encode_latin1`,
  …), never an implicit reinterpretation. There is no `Bytes`-to-`String`
  coercion, no "default charset," and no path that yields text from bytes
  without `bytes_decode`.
- **`bytes_decode` is total with explicit failure.** For valid UTF-8 it returns
  `Ok s`; invalid UTF-8 returns `Err e` for an `e : Utf8Error`. It never returns
  a neutral term or silently substitutes text. AC4's negative face: the
  **only** way to a `String` is this named, fail-visible step; an implicit or
  hidden-charset path is **rejected** (does not exist).

### 1.5 The serialization round-trip law

Over the `bytes_encode`/`bytes_decode` boundary, `BytesRoundTripLaw` is the
**one-directional** round-trip law, **provable** against `20-verification/`.
Its byte input is explicitly conditional on having been produced by
`bytes_encode`:

```
BytesRoundTripLaw :=
  ∀ (s : String). bytes_decode (bytes_encode s) == Ok s
```

- **Why it holds (and the direction matters).** `bytes_encode s` is the UTF-8
  bytes of `s`; `bytes_decode` parses valid UTF-8 (which `bytes_encode` always
  produces) and **re-constructs** a `String`, NFC-normalizing at construction
  (`41 §3a`). Because `s` is **already** NFC and NFC is **idempotent**, the
  reconstructed string equals `s` — so the law holds. The proof obligation is
  **dischargeable** (AC5 asserts the obligation is provable — a verified-
  component target — not merely that one sample round-trips; structural, per
  the untrusted-layer lesson).
- **The reverse is NOT a law — pin the silence so it is not over-claimed.**
  There is no unconditional inverse for arbitrary bytes: from
  `bytes_decode b == Ok s`, it does **not** follow in general that
  `bytes_encode s == b`. Invalid UTF-8 has no `String`, and even valid
  **non-NFC** bytes normalize on `String` construction (`41 §3a`), so
  `bytes_encode` after a successful `bytes_decode` is not the identity on every
  `Bytes`. Conformance must assert only the conditional
  `String → Bytes → Result Utf8Error String` direction above; a general
  `Bytes → String → Bytes` inverse is a **wrong** case (it would reject
  conforming implementations). This is a verdict/law-boundary silence resolved
  **at the source** so the conformance author does not fill it the other way.
- **L6 delivers the interface + the law; the generic derivation is L8.** The
  derivable `encode`/`decode` for **arbitrary** types (the `Serialize`-class
  machinery) is the stdlib follow-on (`L8`); L6 fixes the `Bytes` substrate, the
  `String` boundary, and the round-trip **law/interface** — not the generic
  derivation. The serialization/integrity hash referenced for verified transport
  (a cryptographic/Merkle hash, BLAKE3 recommendation, `41 §3b`) is **separate**
  from in-process addressing (`§1.1`) and is selected downstream, not by L6.

### 1.6 What L6 delivers + acceptance

Team Foundation delivers, in the surface + runtime + prelude: the **`Bytes`
primitive** (`§1.1`, `14 §5` opaque constant + `41 §3a` `0x05` encoding,
immutable, `b"…"`/`0x[…]` literals); the **core ops** (`§1.2`, registered
reductions, `35 §3` partiality); the **effect-tracked I/O surface** (`§1.3`,
each op `visits` its exact row, untracked = type error via the `36 §1.4` escape
check); the explicit **`bytes_encode`/`bytes_decode`** boundary (`§1.4`, no
hidden charset); and the **round-trip law** (`§1.5`, provable,
one-directional). **No new kernel
rule** (`§1.1`); **no `foreign`** (that is L7, `§2`–`§3`).

**Acceptance (AC1–AC5).**

- **AC1 — `Bytes` primitive + immutable.** A `b"…"`/`0x[…]` literal elaborates
  to the `Bytes` primitive (structural assertion on the elaborated value/type,
  not "compiles"); **no mutating op exists**.
- **AC2 — `[FS]` tracked.** `read_bytes` (`visits [FS]`) called from a context
  lacking `FS` is a **type error** (reject); the properly-rowed call **accepts**
  — a **verdict flip**.
- **AC3 — `[Console]` tracked.** `print_line` (`visits [Console]`) — the
  **same** flip on a **distinct**, real effect (the ≥2-effect discrimination of
  `36 §1.4`). A `Net` witness remains deferred until a real producer lands.
- **AC4 — no hidden charset.** Producing text from `Bytes` **requires** the
  named `bytes_decode`; an implicit/hidden-charset path is **rejected** (or
  absent), and invalid input produces `Err`.
- **AC5 — round-trip law.**
  `bytes_decode (bytes_encode s) == Ok s` is **provable** (the obligation is
  dischargeable — structural), not merely sampled; the reverse is **not**
  asserted (`§1.5`).

**Conformance:** `../../conformance/surface/bytes-io/` — AC1–AC5 with per-case
**verdict/structural flip** and the **cross-case sweep** (the effect-tracking
cases `FS`/`Console` agree as one metatheory class). The **QA gate**: the
effect-tracking cases route a **real** I/O signature through the **actual** `36
§1.4` escape check (a real untracked call → real reject), not a synthetic flag.
(The L7 `foreign`/trust-boundary cases live separately under
`../../conformance/surface/ffi-io/`, `§5`.)

### 1.7 Positioned buffer I/O and total `writeAll` (PX8-T)

PX8 adds a bounded mutable-buffer floor without making ordinary Ken values
mutable or affine. `Buffer` is a second runtime resource kind beside
`FsHandle`; its opaque, copyable `BufferHandle` is acquired only through the
public `withBuffer` bracket. Capacity is fixed, strictly positive, and
non-growing for the handle's lifetime. The runtime invalidates escaped copies
when the bracket settles, exactly as for file resources. Allocation consumes
no ambient capability right. It is admitted against one deterministic policy:

```text
BufferLimitsV1 {
  per_buffer_max_capacity: Int,
  invocation_max_live_capacity: Int,
}
```

Both maxima are positive. The first bounds every allocation; the second bounds
the sum of live buffer capacities in one invocation. The complete policy is
bound into the checked/native plan. Reading either limit from an environment
variable, silently growing a buffer, or placing buffers in the capability table
is non-conforming.

The closed resource-kind inventory becomes `FsHandle | Buffer`. Supplying a
live token of the wrong kind produces the distinct fail-visible identity

```text
ResourceKindMismatch {
  expected: ResourceKindV1,
  actual: ResourceKindV1,
}
```

under its own surface constructor and canonical wire discriminator. It is not
`MalformedResource`: the token is valid and live, but belongs to the other
kind. A buffer passed to an Fs-handle-only operation reports
`{ expected: FsHandle, actual: Buffer }`; a file handle passed to a
buffer-only operation reports the reversed payload. Valid same-kind controls
succeed. These two rejecting directions and the two accepting controls are one
non-degenerate conformance unit.

#### 1.7.1 Buffer views and positioned single transfers

There is no hidden file cursor and no mutable buffer cursor. The runtime tracks
one initialized live window per buffer, while Ken observes only:

- the opaque `BufferHandle`;
- an immutable `BufferWindow` request descriptor;
- a constructor-private immutable `BufferSpan` for the exact current live
  subrange; and
- scalar projections, including span length.

The checked handle binds capacity to the exact acquisition, not to a caller's
request:

```ken
data BufferHandle = PrivateBufferHandle (Resource Buffer) Int
```

`withBuffer capacity` is the sole producer of `BufferHandle`. It constructs the
handle only after successfully allocating a buffer of that capacity, then
passes the handle to the bracket body. `PrivateBufferHandle` and both field
projections are absent from the public name map. Checked user code can
therefore neither forge a resource/capacity pairing, replace the stored
capacity, project the raw `Resource Buffer`, nor construct a handle outside
`withBuffer`. The handle may be copied as an ordinary checked value, but every
copy denotes that same acquisition and becomes invalid when the bracket
settles.

The public prelude API has these argument and result shapes:

```ken
proc withBuffer (a : Auth) (e : Type) (r : Type) (capacity : Int)
  (body : BufferHandle -> HostIO a (ResourceBodyResult e r))
  : HostIO a (Result ResourceError (ResourceBracketResult e r)) visits [FS]

proc readAt (a : Auth) (file : Resource FsHandle) (fileOffset : Int)
  (buffer : BufferHandle) (window : BufferWindow)
  : HostIO a (Result ResourceError ReadProgress) visits [FS]

proc writeAt (a : Auth) (file : Resource FsHandle) (fileOffset : Int)
  (buffer : BufferHandle) (span : BufferSpan)
  : HostIO a (Result ResourceError WriteProgress) visits [FS]

proc spanBytes (a : Auth) (buffer : BufferHandle) (span : BufferSpan)
  : HostIO a (Result ResourceError Bytes) visits [FS]

proc freeze (a : Auth) (buffer : BufferHandle) (span : BufferSpan)
  : HostIO a (Result ResourceError Bytes) visits [FS]

proc writeAll (a : Auth) (file : Resource FsHandle) (fileOffset : Int)
  (buffer : BufferHandle) (span : BufferSpan)
  : HostIO a (Result ResourceError Unit) visits [FS]
```

`BufferWindow = MkBufferWindow Int Int` remains the public raw request
descriptor: its fields are caller-chosen and carry no authority. The capacity
used to admit that request is always the constructor-private capacity stored in
the supplied `BufferHandle`, never a caller-supplied capacity or a value derived
from `BufferWindow`.

No pointer, borrowed slice, file descriptor, mutable reference, or backing
region crosses the boundary. `spanBytes` (also called `freeze`) validates a
current span and may copy that bounded span to immutable `Bytes`; it cannot
expose the backing region. A `BufferSpan` carries a constructor-private
structural `Nat` attempt budget equal to its byte length. User code can neither
forge the budget nor choose a different one.

Every `BufferSpan` has an exact buffer-acquisition binding. A successful
`readAt` binds the span it mints to the buffer acquisition used by that call. An
acquisition is one resource lifetime: closing a buffer and later acquiring
another starts a different acquisition, regardless of internal storage reuse.
User code can neither forge nor project the binding. A remainder span derived
by checked library code preserves the original binding.

`spanBytes`/`freeze` and `writeAt` accept a span only with the exact buffer
acquisition to which it is bound. A different acquisition returns
`InvalidBounds`, even when capacity, start, length, and live-window shape all
match. Existing host-width admission retains precedence, so a foreign-span
`writeAt` whose file offset is rejected there still returns `InvalidOffset`.
After host-width admission, span validity is decided before copying or exposing
bytes and before any backend write. Acquisition mismatch and numeric
live-window invalidity deliberately share `InvalidBounds`: both mean that the
span is not valid for the supplied buffer, and no relative ordering between
those two same-identity failures is public. If the acquisition matches, the
existing resource errors retain their identities; in particular, using the
span with that exact acquisition after it closes returns `Closed`.

At the public prelude boundary the two explicitly positioned transfers are:

```text
readAt file fileOffset bufferHandle window
writeAt file fileOffset bufferHandle span
```

For a positive admitted request, each wrapper projects the exact
`Resource Buffer` from `bufferHandle` and invokes exactly one
constructor-private host operation. `spanBytes`/`freeze`, `writeAll`, and
bracket settlement use that same private projection; settlement releases the
exact acquisition stored in the handle. The host resource token, private host
operations, and wire ABI are unchanged. The host repeats its existing
resource-kind, liveness, rights, and range validation as defense in depth; the
checked handle does not replace those checks.

`fileOffset` is nonnegative, and target offset-plus-length arithmetic is checked
for overflow before host I/O. Neither operation mutates a file-description
cursor. Sequential reads, writes, copies, and seek-like state are derived code
that explicitly threads `fileOffset + transferred`; PX8 adds neither a seek
primitive nor vectored I/O.

Derived `readAt` admits a raw `BufferWindow` in this exact order:

1. Validate that `fileOffset` is nonnegative and representable at the host
   width. Failure returns `InvalidOffset` before inspecting the window, so this
   identity has precedence over a simultaneous window fault or closed-endpoint
   request.
2. Project the acquisition capacity from `BufferHandle`. Reject a negative
   `start`, a negative `length`, or `start > capacity` as `InvalidBounds`.
3. Compute `effective = min(length, capacity - start)`. This subtraction is
   nonnegative because step 2 has established `start ≤ capacity`.
4. If and only if `effective = 0`, return `ReadEof` from checked code without
   emitting a private read operation or visiting the host. Thus
   `start = capacity` is an admitted closed endpoint: at capacity `8`, the raw
   request `(start = 8, length = 4)` returns `ReadEof` without a host visit,
   while `start = 9` returns `InvalidBounds`.
5. Otherwise invoke the positive-length private read operation with the exact
   resource stored in the handle and the range `(start, effective)`.
   Offset-plus-effective overflow returns `InvalidOffset` before host I/O.

Consequently a start in the closed range `0 ≤ start ≤ capacity` with a length
beyond the available tail is capped to that tail, producing ordinary short
progress when the effective range is positive. A zero raw length and an
in-range closed endpoint are the two ways to derive a zero-effective
`ReadEof`; neither may invoke a positive-length primitive. A caller-supplied
capacity is never consulted.

A mutating read invalidates the prior live window before the host operation.
Positive success installs exactly the bytes actually read. EOF or error leaves
the live window empty, so a short read cannot make stale bytes current.

#### 1.7.2 The exact progress partition

Progress is represented by operation-specific closed sums:

```text
data ReadProgress
  = ReadSome BufferSpan TransferCount
  | ReadEof

data WriteProgress
  = Wrote TransferCount
```

`TransferCount` is constructor-private, strictly positive, and bounded by the
effective request: the post-validation length after any in-range tail cap. For
`readAt`, this is the post-cap window length; for `writeAt`, it is the remaining
input-span length. For a count `n`, `0 < n ≤ effective request`, and its
remaining request budget is `effective request - n`; the raw caller-requested
length is not a progress bound after capping. Thus a tail-capped `readAt` with
raw request 8, effective request 4, and count and span length 4 has remaining
request budget 0 and total request budget `count + remaining = 4`. It has an
`Int` projection. `ReadSome`'s `BufferSpan` and count are minted together, and
the span length equals the count by construction.
`Complete` and `Partial` are derived comparisons between the count and effective
request; they are not runtime constructors or statuses. The checked view of a
count carries its positivity and upper-bound witnesses; user code cannot detach
those witnesses from the value or construct a count that violates them. The
downstream proof therefore eliminates the checked result structure rather than
postulating a fact about an arbitrary `Int`.

For a positive effective request, the partition is exact:

| Host observation | Result |
|---|---|
| read returns zero | `ReadEof` |
| read returns `0 < n ≤ effective request` | `ReadSome span n`, including a short read |
| write returns `0 < n ≤ effective request` | `Wrote n`, including a short write |
| write returns zero | error `NoProgress`, never `Wrote` |

`NoProgress` is the surface identity for the write-zero condition (also called
`WriteZero` at a host boundary); it is not a successful progress value.

The following are errors, never progress: `Revoked`, `Closed`,
`MalformedResource`, `ResourceKindMismatch`, `RightNotHeld`, invalid
offset/window/bounds, buffer-limit or allocation failure,
unsupported/nonblocking posture, and host I/O failure. `Revoked` means an
otherwise well-formed, live, sufficiently-righted operation lost at `62 §4.2`'s
admission boundary; it is not an alias for a neighbouring error. `Interrupted`
is a named error unless a separately specified and tested backend retry policy
consumes it internally. `WouldBlock` belongs to PX12 and is not a PX8 progress
status. PX9 may refine error payloads but must not change this progress partition
or collapse the `Revoked` identity.

The private positive-transfer contracts re-exposed by the checked wrappers
include these propositions:

- **write positivity/bounds:** successful `writeAt` on positive remaining bytes
  yields `Wrote n` with `0 < n ≤ remaining`;
- **read positivity/bounds:** successful `readAt` on a positive effective
  request yields either `ReadEof` or `ReadSome span n` with
  `0 < n ≤ effective request` and `length span = n`;
- **position and bounds:** every transfer uses the explicit nonnegative file
  offset and an overflow-checked effective range; and
- **tail capping:** a request that starts in range but extends beyond the buffer
  tail uses the capped effective range for every progress bound and remaining
  request budget, while an out-of-range start fails.

The positivity propositions are reasonable-from contracts of the opaque
runtime operation. They are fixed, audited primitive guarantees rather than a
fresh `Axiom` at each caller. In particular, the `writeAll` proof below consumes
write positivity; it does not assume progress from a runtime hope.

#### 1.7.3 Derived `writeAll` and its theorem

`writeAll` is transparent checked Ken code, not a host primitive. It takes a
positioned file handle, `BufferHandle`, and `BufferSpan`, derives structural
`Nat` fuel from the span's constructor-private attempt budget, and calls
`writeAt` until the span is empty or the first transfer error occurs. The fuel
is never caller-supplied.

Let `B` be the initial span's bytes, `L` its byte length, and
`n₁, …, nₖ` the counts returned by successful primitive calls in source order.
Let `N = n₁ + … + nₖ`. The required theorem is the conjunction of:

1. **termination:** `writeAll` performs at most `L` primitive calls and always
   returns;
2. **exact-prefix invariant:** after every successful-call prefix,
   `0 ≤ N ≤ L`, the file offset and span start have both advanced by `N`, the
   remaining length is `L - N`, and the bytes written are exactly `B[0..N)`;
3. **success completeness:** `writeAll` returns success only when `N = L`, so
   the entire input span has been written;
4. **first-error preservation:** if the next primitive call returns transfer
   error `e`, including `NoProgress`, `writeAll` returns that same first `e`
   after exactly the prefix `B[0..N)` and makes no claim about bytes after that
   prefix; and
5. **all-success corollary:** if every primitive call succeeds, `writeAll`
   returns success and writes all of `B`.

The executable helper matches the structural budget. Empty input succeeds
without a host call. In the `Suc fuel` branch it performs one positive-length
`writeAt`; `Wrote n` advances offset and span by `n`, decreases remaining bytes
strictly, and recurses with `fuel`; an error returns unchanged. Since every
successful count is positive and at most the remaining length, no more than the
original byte length successful steps are possible. Fuel exhaustion with bytes
remaining is excluded by the positivity lemma and is not a user-visible error.

PX8-F must supply real kernel-checked terms that consume the checked
positivity/bounds witnesses and prove strict decrease, fuel sufficiency,
success-implies-full-transfer, and error-prefix preservation. None may be an
`Axiom` or a postulated `writeAll` theorem. Ward owns the resource-lifetime
property of `71 §2.3`; it is not the termination proof.

The conformance route has four independently reaching observations:

1. all full writes return success with the whole span written;
2. at least one positive short write still reaches success with exact prefix
   accounting;
3. a write-zero reaches and returns `NoProgress`; and
4. a mid-stream transfer error returns that exact error after the exact written
   prefix.

Each seed must prove that its named branch was reached. A suite-green result or
an output shared by a different branch is not evidence for this contract.

## 2. The FFI surface — the `foreign` declaration

A **`foreign`** declaration binds a Ken name to an external (C-ABI) symbol,
giving it a **Ken type** and a **declared effect row**. It is the one surface
form that crosses out of the checked language, so it is built to make that
crossing **typed, effect-rowed, and visible** — never an untyped escape hatch.

```
foreign c_sqrt : Float → Float
  = symbol "sqrt"  library "m"  pure

foreign os_write : Int32 → Bytes → Int  visits [FS]
  = symbol "write"  library "c"
```

### 2.1 The declaration form (grammar + elaboration entry)

The `foreign` form extends the V0/`33` declaration grammar:

```
foreign-decl ::= "foreign" ident ":" type effect-row? "=" foreign-body
foreign-body ::= "symbol" string ("library" string)? "pure"?
effect-row   ::= "visits" "[" label ("," label)* "]"      -- 36 §1
```

- A `foreign` decl carries four things: a Ken **type** `T`, a **declared effect
  row** `ρ` (`visits [...]`; `pure` is the surface spelling of the **empty row**
  `ρ = ∅`), a C **symbol** name, and an optional **library**.
- `pure` and a non-empty `visits ρ` are **mutually exclusive**: `pure ≡ visits
  []`. A decl with neither defaults to `pure` (empty row) — and is then subject
  to §3.4 (a world-touching symbol with no row is the named residual, not a
  silent pass).
- **Spelling deferral (`OQ-syntax`, defer-spelling-not-concept).** The exact
  surface tokens (`foreign`/`symbol`/`library`/`pure`/`visits`) are reserved
  keywords whose literal spelling the build team finalizes; what is **locked
  here** is the **structure** (type + row + symbol + library), the **type+row
  obligation**, and the **postulate wiring** (§2.3). Conformance pins the
  structure and `(oracle)`-tags the literal keyword (assert-at-locked-
  granularity).

### 2.2 C-ABI marshalling (reuses L6)

A call to a `foreign` marshals Ken values to/from their C-ABI representations
following the primitive lowering (`41 §1`):

| Ken type | C-ABI representation | Source |
|---|---|---|
| scalars `Int*`/`UInt*`/`Float*`/`Bool`/`Char` | the named machine type (`i64`/`f64`/`i1`/`u32`/…) | `41 §1` typed immediates |
| `Bytes` | **`(ptr, len)`** — a pointer + length pair | L6 `§1.1`, `41 §1` |
| handle / `section` | runtime-defined opaque handle | `41 §1`, `44` |

- `Bytes` ↔ `(ptr, len)` is the **L6 boundary** (`§1.1`) — L7 **rides it, does
  not re-derive** (guardrail). L6 keeps that boundary clean and explicit
  precisely so this marshalling needs no rework.
- Marshalling is a **runtime-lowering** concern (`41`), **not a kernel rule**:
  the kernel sees only the `foreign`'s assumed Ken type (§2.3); the (ptr,len) /
  scalar lowering happens at the call in the runtime, below the trusted
  boundary.
- The FFI is **general** — any C-ABI symbol — **not** a fixed allowlist of
  externals. Generality is safe because every use is an explicit, *listed*
  concession (§3).

### 2.3 Elaboration — a `foreign` is a postulate

A `foreign f : T visits ρ = symbol "…"` elaborates to a **postulate** of the
rowed Ken type. The defensive elaboration entry:

```
elabForeign(Σ, ⟨ foreign f : T visits ρ = symbol s library l [pure] ⟩):
  T'  := elabType(·, rowed(T, ρ))      -- the latent-row type A →[ρ] B (36 §1); pure ⇒ ρ=∅
  id  := declare_postulate(Σ, f, [], T')  -- required label = foreign declaration name
  recordForeign(id, symbol = s, library = l, row = ρ)   -- elaborator-side link/marshalling record
  bind f ↦ id
```

- The kernel admits `f` as an **opaque constant** `f : T'` (`11 §4`: an opaque
  constant blocks δ and "is how axioms, **FFI signatures**, and abstract
  interfaces are represented") — there is **no body to unfold**, and it is
  **recorded in `trusted_base()`** (`18 §4.2`, the `declare_postulate` contract:
  "`id` admitted opaque; recorded in the trusted base").
- **No new kernel rule** (guardrail). `declare_postulate` is the **existing**
  kernel API (`18 §4.1`); the type+row is ordinary `36 §1` machinery; the
  symbol/library/marshalling is an **elaborator-side** record consulted by the
  runtime, never by the kernel. L7 adds **zero** kernel formation rules (the
  level-discipline reconcile is therefore trivially a pass — no new universe or
  former appears).

## 3. The trust boundary (the load-bearing part)

FFI is where Ken's guarantees **stop**. The discipline marks that frontier
**honestly and structurally**: every foreign is assumed, *listed*, effect-rowed,
and capability-gated — and the one soundness gap the type system cannot
mechanically close is **named** (§3.4), never hidden.

### 3.1 Foreign-as-listed-postulate → the trusted base (the honesty headline)

This is the load-bearing AC2 mechanism — the honesty-about-the-boundary
principle made structural.

- A `foreign` postulate (§2.3) is in `trusted_base()` (`18 §5`).
- A verified **artifact's** `trusted_base_delta` (`25 §3`) is the set of
  `trusted_base()` postulates its checked content **transitively depends on** —
  its **dependency cone**. The B1 export (`71`) computes it from
  `trusted_base()` membership over the artifact's verified content.
- **Resolve the silence — "relies on" is by *use*, not *declaration*.** A
  `foreign` decl in scope is **not** itself a reliance; what lists `os_write` in
  an artifact's delta is a verified definition that **calls** `os_write`. A
  `view` that calls it has `os_write` in its delta; a `view` that does not is
  **absent** from it — even with the `foreign` decl visible in the same module.
  The honesty property ranges over **the foreign functions the verified content
  reaches**, exactly as `18 §5` reads `trusted_base()` ("the assumptions a given
  program *depends on*") and `71 §2.1` reads the boundary ("which foreign
  functions it *relies on*"). (Pinning this at the source so the conformance
  author nets reliance-by-call, not the vacuous decl-lists-itself.)
- The B1 export projects every `trusted_base_delta` postulate into the **`P`
  (assumptions)** field, tagged `tested`, under the **FFI boundary-label** case
  (`71 §2.1` names "FFI" among the boundary labels feeding `P`; invariant I2,
  `71 §3.1`). So **a verified artifact's exported contract lists exactly the
  foreign functions it relies on — visible, not hidden.**
- **AC2 flips on dependency:** relied-on ⇒ the foreign's postulate is a `P`
  entry; not-relied-on ⇒ absent (and the export hash changes, `71 §3.3`).
  Conformance routes a **real** `foreign` decl through the **real** B1 export
  and observes the foreign in `P` — never a synthetic trust-base literal. This
  is the **FFI instance** of B1's assumption-visibility (subsumes
  `export/removing-assume-shrinks-P`, `71 §3.1` I2 — subsume-don't-proliferate).

### 3.2 `pure` is a claim, not a check — projects to *trusted*, never `Q`

The kernel **cannot check C**. A `foreign`'s type — including a `pure`
(empty-row) claim of referential transparency — is **assumed**, never verified;
it is part of the trusted boundary, and is the AC3 mechanism.

- **The no-over-claim projection (`71` I1).** A `foreign`'s assumed guarantee is
  a **postulate** of its type, so its goal **is** a member of `trusted_base()`.
  By the structural discriminator (`21 §5.4`, `71 §2.1`: a claim is `Q` **iff**
  its certificate `check`s **and** its goal is **not** a `trusted_base()`
  postulate) it can **never** project to `Q`. A `pure foreign`'s guarantee lands
  in **`P`/trusted** (`tested`), **never** kernel-certified `Q`. **Under-claim
  is the safe direction**: filing the assumed claim as `Q` would over-claim a
  kernel certification that does not exist.
- This is the FFI instance of the **trusted-by-typing-is-not-`Q`** discipline
  (cf. Sec1's declassify edge, B1's I1): a guarantee resting on a **trusted
  meta-claim** ("the C symbol is referentially transparent") is **not
  kernel-proved**, so it projects to *trusted*, not `Q`.
- A **wrong `pure`** is a soundness bug **confined to that postulate — and it is
  *listed*** (§3.1): even an incorrect purity claim cannot masquerade as proved,
  and the assumption itself is visible in `P`.
- **Discriminating, not green-vs-green.** *Nothing* about a foreign is ever in
  `Q`, so "the foreign is absent from `Q`" alone is vacuous. The net is the
  **pair on the same artifact**: a genuinely kernel-proved Ken-side
  postcondition (a `view` wrapping the foreign, whose `ensures` over the
  *marshalling* — not the C body — discharges) projects to **`Q`** **while** the
  foreign's assumed `pure`/type claim projects to **`P`** — the field tracks
  **kernel-provedness**, not the `pure` keyword. The bug (trust the `pure`
  annotation, bucket it as a guarantee) lands the assumption in `Q` → red.
  (Reuses B1 EX-A's proved↔assumed pair, here
  `kernel-proved`↔`foreign-assumed`.)

### 3.3 Boundary contracts → runtime-checked assertions

A `requires`/`ensures` on a `foreign` is a proposition over an **opaque**
postulate (the AC4 mechanism).

- Where it is **statically unprovable** (the kernel has no body to reason
  about), it lowers to the **`tested`** epistemic status (`21 §5.2`): a
  **runtime-checked, fail-fast assertion** at the call boundary, **plus** a
  visible `P`/`tested` entry in the assumption boundary. This is **the** place
  runtime contracts earn their keep (`21 §5.2` names exactly "boundaries, FFI,
  untrusted input"): an unverifiable boundary becomes a **fail-fast** one rather
  than a silently-assumed one.
- **Structural, not "accepts."** Conformance observes the **emitted runtime
  check** (the lowered assertion exists at the call site) + the `tested` `P`
  entry — never merely that the program compiles (the discriminating-output
  discipline). A `foreign` `ensures` that **is** statically discharged (proved
  over the Ken-side marshalling) needs no runtime check and may reach `Q`
  (§3.2); the **unprovable** one **must** emit the runtime check — the two faces
  flip on static provability.

### 3.4 Effects are mandatory — and the one residual the discipline cannot catch

The AC5 mechanism: a catchable flip plus the single named gap (the honest limit,
`64`).

- **The catchable flip (the net).** A world-touching `foreign` carries its
  effect row (§2.1). A caller that performs the foreign's effect **without**
  declaring the matching row in its own signature is an **EFFECT-ESCAPE** static
  error (`36 §1.4`: `ρ_inf ⊄ ρ_decl`) — the **same** escape check L6 I/O rides
  (`§1.3`), **not** a new gate. A `view` calling `os_write` (`visits [FS]`)
  without `[FS]` in its declared row is **rejected**; with `[FS]`, it
  **accepts** — a **verdict flip** on a **real** foreign through the **real**
  escape check.
- **The residual (the honest limit).** A `foreign` declared **`pure`** (empty
  row) whose C symbol **actually performs I/O** is the **one** gap the type
  discipline **cannot mechanically catch**: the kernel sees an empty row, no
  caller is forced to declare an effect, and the real I/O is invisible to
  typing. This is a **reviewer-surfaced flag**, **not** a verdict the type
  system flips. It is **mitigated, not eliminated**, by §3.1 — the mis-declared
  foreign is still a *listed* postulate, so the wrong claim is at least
  **visible** in `P`. Name it as the residual; **never** silently treat a
  `pure`-but-effectful foreign as sound (the conformance case asserts it is
  *flagged*, not accepted as a netted verdict).

## 4. Capabilities and least authority (couples Sec2)

A `foreign` world-action requires **two independent concessions**, and dropping
**either** rejects (the AC6 composition with Sec1/Sec2):

1. its **effect row** (`36 §1.4`, §3.4) — *may this code perform this effect*;
   and
2. the **gating capability** — a `Cap_FS`/`Cap_Net`/… token passed at the call
   (`using c : Cap E`, `36 §3`; the authority face, Sec2 `62`) — *is this code
   authorized to perform it*.

- The capability gate is **Sec2's** discipline (`62`): no ambient authority,
  least by default, the cap a real Π value the call needs (`36 §2.5`). A
  `foreign os_write` call in a context holding **no** `Cap_FS` is rejected
  **even if** its `[FS]` row is declared (the authority is missing); a context
  with `Cap_FS` but **no** `[FS]` row is rejected by the escape check (§3.4).
  **Both** are required — the composition keeps the unverified surface of any
  program **explicit and minimal**.
- **The trusted boundary is a small, enumerated set** (guardrail): the verified
  core stays pure; every FFI use is a *listed* foreign postulate (§3.1) **plus**
  an explicit capability — never an ambient escape.

## 5. Honest limits — kernel-checked vs trusted vs the named residual

Where Ken's guarantee sits, per boundary fact — the honest accounting (`64`):

| Boundary fact | Status | Netted by |
|---|---|---|
| The foreign's **Ken type** (arg/result shape, effect row) | **assumed** (postulate, `11 §4`) | listed in `trusted_base_delta` → `P` (§3.1) |
| A **statically-proved** Ken-side contract over the marshalling | **`Q`** (kernel-certified) | kernel `check` (`18 §4.5`) |
| A **statically-unprovable** `requires`/`ensures` on the foreign | **`tested`** | runtime-checked assertion (§3.3) + `P` |
| The **`pure`** / referential-transparency claim | **trusted**, never `Q` (§3.2) | listed; never kernel-certified |
| The **effect row** on the foreign, at call sites | **enforced** | `36 §1.4` escape check (§3.4) — the flip |
| A **`pure`-but-effectful** foreign | **the residual** | reviewer flag only (§3.4) — listed, not caught |

The single honest gap is the last row: the discipline **names** it but cannot
mechanically close it. Everything else is either kernel-checked (`Q`),
runtime-checked (`tested`), or **listed-as-assumed** (`P`) — never hidden. The
goal of the whole chapter is that the unverified surface of any program is
**small, explicit, and enumerable** — not zero (FFI is necessary), but *honest*.

## 6. What WS-L must deliver here (L6, L7)

This WS-L accounting covers §1.1–§1.6 and §2–§5. The additive §1.7
contract is PX8-R/PX8-F work and is not represented here as an L6/L7 delivery.

`Bytes` + binary I/O (effect-tracked, encode/decode to `String`) — **elaborated
in §1.1–§1.6, the L6 deliverable**; lawful, derivable serialization with a
provable round-trip (the **law/interface in §1.5**; the generic derivation is
L8). And
(**L7**, §2–§5): a **general** `foreign` FFI with typed/effect-rowed bindings
and C-ABI marshalling (§2); the trust-boundary discipline — foreign-as-listed-
postulate (§3.1), `pure`-as-claim-not-`Q` (§3.2), runtime contracts at the edge
(§3.3), mandatory effects + the named residual (§3.4); and capability gating
(§4). **No new kernel rule** (§2.3).

**L7 acceptance (AC1–AC5; ties to G6** — ≥1 FFI call in a verified component,
with the trust base showing exactly what is assumed):

- **AC1 — `foreign` binds + marshals.** A `foreign` decl elaborates to a typed,
  effect-rowed postulate (§2.3); a call marshals `Bytes`↔`(ptr,len)` + scalars↔
  machine types (§2.2) — a **structural** assertion on the binding/marshalling,
  not "compiles".
- **AC2 — foreign-as-listed-postulate (honesty headline, discriminating).** An
  artifact that **relies on** `foreign f` (calls it) has `f`'s postulate in its
  `trusted_base_delta` → `P`; one that does **not** is **absent** (§3.1). Routed
  through the **real** B1 export; the verdict flips on **dependency**.
- **AC3 — `pure` projects to *trusted*, never `Q`.** A `pure foreign`'s
  guarantee is assumed → `P`/`tested`, **never** `Q` (§3.2); under-claim is the
  safe direction. A genuinely-proved Ken-side claim in the *same* artifact
  reaches `Q` — the field tracks kernel-provedness, not the `pure` keyword.
- **AC4 — boundary contracts runtime-checked.** A statically-unprovable
  `requires`/`ensures` on a `foreign` lowers to a **runtime-checked** fail-fast
  assertion + a `tested` `P` entry (§3.3) — observe the **emitted** check, not a
  silent assumption.
- **AC5 — effects mandatory (discriminating).** A world-touching `foreign` whose
  effect escapes the caller's declared row is **rejected** (`36 §1.4`); the
  properly-rowed call **accepts** — a verdict flip (§3.4). The **`pure`-but-
  effectful** case is the **named residual** (flagged, not silently accepted as
  sound).

Conformance:
- `../../conformance/surface/bytes-io/` — the L6 `Bytes`/I/O/encode-decode/
  round-trip cases (`§1.6`).
- `../../conformance/surface/ffi-io/` — (L7) AC1–AC5 with per-case verdict/
  structural flip, the **AC2 honesty pair** (relied-on listed / not-relied-on
  absent, through the real export) and the **AC3 pure-not-`Q` pair**, the **AC5
  effects-mandatory flip + the named residual**, the **capability+effect
  composition** (`§4`), and a **G6 serialization round-trip proof** in an
  FFI-using verified component (a `foreign` decl whose postulate shows up in
  `trusted_base_delta`). **QA gate:** AC2/AC3 route a **real** `foreign` through
  the **actual** export/trust-base machinery (postulate listed, never `Q`); no
  synthetic trust-base literal.
