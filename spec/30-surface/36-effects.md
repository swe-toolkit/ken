## 1. Effects as a static row

A definition is **pure** by default (a `const` or `fn`, §1.6); a `proc` that
performs an effect declares an **effect row**:

```
proc read_config (path : String) : Config  visits [FS] = …
proc now () : Instant                       visits [Clock] = …
proc greet (name : String) : Unit           visits [Console] = …
```

- An **effect** (`FS`, `Clock`, `Console`, `Net`, `Rand`, …) is a named
  capability a computation may use. The row `visits [E₁, …]` is part of the
  function's type.
- **Statically checked + transitively inferred:** calling an effectful function
  *requires* its effects to be in the caller's row; the checker **infers** a
  function's effects from its body (transitive closure of what it calls), and
  reports a mismatch where a declared row omits an effect actually used. So
  effects cannot be silently performed — a pure-typed function is pure (the
  verification layer relies on this: a `fn`/`const` with no row is a
  mathematical function and its `ensures` are about values, not world-state).
- **Purity is the default and the common case;** only boundary functions carry
  rows, which keeps the verification core (`../20-verification/`) reasoning over
  pure terms.

### 1.1 The row lattice and latent-effect arrows

Fix, per program, the finite set `𝓔` of effect labels — the declared effects
(`FS`, `Console`, …) plus one label per `space` (§4). A **row** `ρ ⊆ 𝓔` is a
finite set of labels, ordered by `⊆`, with join `∪`, meet `∩`, and bottom `∅`
(the **pure** row). Rows form a finite (bounded) lattice — the property that
makes inference a terminating fixpoint (§1.3).

Function types carry a **latent row**: the arrow is written

```
(x : A) →[ρ] B          -- ρ is released when the function is APPLIED
A → B   ≡   A →[∅] B     -- a pure arrow performs nothing on application
```

`ρ` is the effect a call to the function may perform — exactly what `visits ρ`
pins at a boundary. The latent row sits on the **arrow**, not merely on the
definition, because higher-order code demands it: `map`'s effects depend on its
function argument, and only a latent row on that argument's arrow lets `map`'s
own row be expressed —

```
map : (A →[ρ] B) → List A →[ρ] List B      -- map is row-polymorphic in ρ
```

This latent-effect arrow is the **cross-workstream interface** (§3.1) that Sec/B
read a function's effects and labels off of.

### 1.2 Transitive inference (the algorithm)

The checker infers each definition's row bottom-up over its body and the call
graph. `infer_row(Γ, e) : Row` computes the effects an expression performs
**when evaluated** (call-by-value, `../40-runtime/42-evaluation.md`):

```
infer_row(Γ, e) = match e:
  x | c            (variable / global constant)  → ∅
                     -- a value; naming or projecting it performs nothing
  perform_E op     (a primitive op of effect E)  → {E}
                     -- the ONE place a label is introduced
  λ (x:A). b       (abstraction)                 → ∅
                     -- building a closure performs nothing; infer_row(Γ,x:A ⊢ b)
                     -- becomes the latent row ρ on the arrow (x:A) →[ρ] B
  f a              (application)                  → infer_row(Γ,f)
                                                  ∪ infer_row(Γ,a)
                                                  ∪ latent(typeof(Γ,f))
                     -- evaluate operator, operand, THEN release the call's latent ρ
  let b1; …; bn in body                           → infer_row(Γ₀,rhs₁) ∪ …
                                                    ∪ infer_row(Γₙ₋₁,rhsₙ)
                                                    ∪ infer_row(Γₙ,body)
  if c then t else u  /  match c { … }            → infer_row(Γ,c) ∪ ⋃ (branch rows)
  handle_E h c     (handler, §5)                  → (infer_row(Γ,c) \ {E}) ∪ rows(h)
                     -- handling E DISCHARGES it from the row
  g                (call to a top-level def)      → row(g)
                     -- g's inferred/declared latent row, via the call graph
```

- `latent(τ)` reads the latent row off an arrow type `A →[ρ] B` and is `∅` for a
  non-arrow type. Applying `f` *releases* `f`'s latent row; the operator and
  operand are evaluated first, so their own rows join in.
- `λ` has row `∅` and **defers** its body's row to the arrow as the latent `ρ` —
  this is what gives the latent-arrow its meaning and what makes higher-order
  functions row-polymorphic (the `ρ` instantiates per call site, below).
- In the grouped-`let` clause, `Γ₀ = Γ` and `Γᵢ` extends `Γᵢ₋₁` with
  binding `b_i`. The union computes the static row; it does not license
  reordering.
  Evaluation and the effect-tree denotation sequence the RHSs strictly in
  source order, once each, before the body (§2.4). The one-binding form is the
  `n = 1` case.

### 1.3 Recursion — least fixpoint over the call graph

Mutually recursive definitions cannot be inferred in one bottom-up pass. Build
the call graph; for each strongly-connected component assign a row variable
`ρ_d` per definition `d`, emit the constraint `ρ_d ⊇ infer_row(body_d)`
(monotone in the `ρ`s it mentions), and solve by **least fixpoint**:

```
solve(SCC):
  for d in SCC: ρ_d := ∅
  repeat:
    for d in SCC: ρ_d := ρ_d ∪ infer_row(body_d)   -- reading current ρ's for in-SCC calls
  until no ρ_d changed
```

- **Termination.** Each `ρ_d` ranges over the powerset of the finite `𝓔` (height
  `|𝓔|`); the update operator is monotone (`∪`-only); so the iteration reaches a
  fixpoint in at most `|𝓔|` rounds per SCC. This is the standard finite-lattice
  dataflow fixpoint — it does **not** rely on SCT (`../10-kernel/17 §4`); the
  row lattice is finite by construction.
- **Higher-order arguments.** A call to a *parameter* `f : A →[ρ_f] B`
  contributes the latent `ρ_f`, where at a concrete call site `ρ_f` is the
  latent row of the **actual** argument's arrow type — row polymorphism falls
  out of substituting the argument's type into the callee's signature; there is
  no surface row-variable binder.

### 1.4 Checking — declared rows and the escape error

A definition may carry a **declared** row `visits ρ_decl` — **mandatory** at a
boundary (`foreign`, `../30-surface/38-ffi-io.md`; a `space` op, §4), optional
elsewhere. Let `ρ_inf = infer_row(body)`. The check is:

```
ρ_inf ⊆ ρ_decl                 -- accept
ρ_inf ⊄ ρ_decl                 -- EFFECT-ESCAPE static error
```

- `⊆`, not `=`: a function may **declare more than it uses** (a stable interface
  that reserves headroom); declaring *less* than it uses is the error.
- On failure the checker names **each** escaping effect `E ∈ ρ_inf \ ρ_decl` and
  a **witness** — the `perform_E` or the call whose latent row first introduces
  `E` along the inferred path — so the diagnostic points at a source site, not
  just a set difference.
- **Pure by default = the headline case.** No `visits` ⇒ `ρ_decl = ∅` ⇒ any
  non-empty `ρ_inf` escapes ⇒ **performing an undeclared effect is a compile
  error** (acceptance criterion 1). This is the guarantee the verification core
  rests on: a row-`∅` `fn`/`const` is *provably* effect-free and treated as a
  mathematical function (`../20-verification/`).

The escape check is the **single soundness-relevant gate** of the row system, so
its conformance must *discriminate* (§7.5, COORDINATION §7): the same body
**accepts** under a correct `visits` and **rejects** when one effect is dropped
— a verdict flip, not a single happy path — exercised with **≥2 distinct
effects**.

## 1.5 Row variables — the surface for effect polymorphism (`OQ-8` child)

> Status: **normative extension of §1.2/§1.3** (Architect-grounded on the landed
> effect checker, D1). `OQ-8` DECIDED the model — interaction trees, latent
> arrows, capability-passing, Koka rows the cited precedent; the row variable is
> *implied by that denotation* and here made **surface-writable**. This is a
> pure spec addition (surface syntax + a bounded inference lift), **not** a new
> operator fork and **kernel-untouched**; recorded in the OQ register as an
> `OQ-8` child pin.

Row polymorphism is **already in the model** — §1.1's latent arrow makes `map`'s
row depend on its argument's row, and §1.3 solves higher-order calls by
*substituting the actual argument's latent row*. But that polymorphism is
**inferred-from-the-argument only**: §1.3 states plainly *"there is no surface
row-variable binder."* A higher-order function that is *declared* to be
effect-polymorphic — `traverse`, whose signature must **name** the effect its
callback may perform — has no way to write that variable. §1.5 adds it.

### 1.5.1 Syntax — a bare row variable and the open-row tail

A **row variable** is a lowercase identifier standing for an unknown row,
written in brackets exactly where a concrete row goes:

```
proc traverse (f : a →[e] b) (xs : List a) : List b  visits [e]
```

- **`[e]`** — a **fully polymorphic** row: the definition performs *exactly*
  whatever its higher-order argument performs, nothing more.
- **`[E | e]`** — an **open row**: a concrete head `E` the definition performs
  *itself*, joined with a polymorphic tail `e` it inherits from an argument
  (e.g. a `proc` that logs to `Console` **and** runs a caller-supplied callback
  is `visits [Console | e]`). This denotes to the row join `⟦E⟧ ∪ ⟦e⟧` (§1.1)
  and is the bullet the row lattice's `∪` already provides.

Both forms are accepted; a bare `[e]` is the `E = ∅` special case of `[E | e]`.
The `→[e]` latent-arrow spelling (§1.1) and the monadic `Eff [e] b` spelling
denote to the same latent row on the argument's arrow; surface *spelling* stays
`OQ-syntax`; the **construct** — a row variable in a declared row — normative.

### 1.5.2 Binding — an implicit parameter, one variable, two occurrences

A row variable **binds as an implicit parameter**, exactly like an implicit
type or level parameter (`39 §2.2`) — **not a new binder kind**. (Precedent:
`State s` already threads an implicit *type* parameter into an effect label,
§4.5.1; a row variable threads an implicit *row*.) It is **bound once**
and **referenced twice** — in the higher-order argument's latent row and in the
definition's own declared row — and the surface resolver maps **both occurrences
to the same variable**. So `traverse` above elaborates with a leading implicit
`{e}`; its escape obligation (§1.4) is the reflexive `e ⊆ e`, which holds by
construction.

**The surface variable is required, not optional (§3.1 guarantee 1).** A
function's effects must be recoverable from its **type**, never only from its
body (manifest-in-the-type). A purely-inferred, never-written row variable would
violate that for the polymorphic case, and the purity check (§1.6) must read the
polymorphic row **off the signature**. So a row-polymorphic definition **must**
write its variable in the declared row; an effect-polymorphic body with no
declared variable is a manifest-in-the-type violation, reported like an escape
(§1.4).

### 1.5.3 Static closure at every instantiation (AC3 — structural)

A row variable is eliminated in exactly one of two ways, and **neither discovers
an effect at runtime**:

- **Instantiation.** A call that supplies a *concrete* higher-order argument
  substitutes the variable with that argument's concrete latent row (§1.3's
  substitution, lifted to the named variable). The result row is concrete.
- **Deferral.** A caller that is *itself* row-polymorphic passes the variable
  through unchanged — nothing is performed *here*; the obligation rides onward
  on the caller's own declared variable.

At any **program boundary** — a handler (§5) or the runtime driver (§7.2) — the
row must be **concrete**: you cannot *run* a variable. Every `Vis` node is a
static `perform` or comes from a statically-typed higher-order closure. So every
concrete instantiation of a row-polymorphic definition has a **statically-closed
effect set** — AC3 is a **structural property of elaboration**, not a runtime
check.

### 1.5.4 Interaction with capabilities and handlers (no break)

- **No `Cap e` for the variable part — and that is correct (§2.5/§3).** A
  row-polymorphic `proc` performs its polymorphic effects **only through its
  higher-order argument** — a closure the *caller* built with its own
  capabilities in scope. `traverse` never `perform`s `e` itself; it splices the
  callback's sub-trees with `bind` (§2.4). So the capability-passing translation
  needs **no capability parameter for `e`**: the definition's own open row of
  *direct* performs is `∅` (consistent with §1.2's λ rule — building a closure
  performs nothing). Authority rides the function argument, exactly where the
  effect does.
- **Row-polymorphic handling (§5).** A handler `ITree (E ⊕ F) R → ITree F R'`
  discharges `E` and leaves `F`; if the residual `F` is a variable, the residual
  tree `ITree (Var e) R'` stays polymorphic — a handler may fold a *subset* of a
  polymorphic row and leave the rest polymorphic. Totality + single-consumption
  (§5.2) are properties of the **fold** (`elim_ITree`) and the handler clauses,
  **invariant** under whether the residual row is concrete or a variable (the
  variable is a type-level artifact; the tree the fold walks is unchanged). No
  break to the `OQ-9` totality story.

### 1.5.5 Recursion over a row variable — the fixpoint lift (build seam)

§1.3's least-fixpoint infers a **recursive** definition's row by iterating to a
fixed point over the call graph. Today it ranges over **concrete** rows. A
recursive *row-polymorphic* definition — and `traverse` is one the moment it is
written, since it folds a `List` recursively — needs that fixpoint **lifted
to range over row-variable rows**. The lift is mechanically stable: the
join over a variable is idempotent (`e ∪ e = e`), the update stays monotone, and
the iteration still terminates (a variable adds no new lattice height). This is
the row-polymorphism analog of CAT-1's bounded elaborator extension —
**outer-ring, kernel-untouched, no new `Term`/`Decl`** — flagged here so
the build does not meet it cold (the non-recursive symbolic path already exists;
only the recursive fixpoint needs the lift).

**Fail-closed completeness residual (a note for conformance, not a soundness
hole).** The subset test for an open row — is a concrete row `⊆ [E | e]`? —
is **conservative**: it may *under-accept* a concrete row straddling both the
concrete head and the polymorphic tail. That is a **completeness** gap (it
rejects a valid program), **never** an over-acceptance (no effect can silently
escape), so it is sound for the escape gate; the residual is a *rejected-valid*,
which conformance pins as a known-completeness marker (§7.5), never a verdict
flip on soundness.

## 1.6 Purity as a checked keyword — `const` / `fn` / `proc` (SURF-1)

> Status: **normative.** Operator ruling (Pat, 2026-07-04): the single
> definition keyword `view` is **retired** and split into three keywords that
> **agree, by a checked bidirectional rule, with a definition's static purity**.
> The keyword becomes a **reliable signal** — reading `fn` guarantees "an
> unconditionally pure function"; `proc` warns "at least potentially
> impure/imperative." Purity is **checked at the definition site**, not a
> convention. Grammar: `32 §1`, `33 §1`. Kernel-untouched (this is a
> surface keyword + an elaborator check over the §1.2–§1.5 row inference; no new
> kernel rule, `Term`, or `Decl`). Recorded in the OQ register as an `OQ-8`
> child pin. Spellings `const`/`fn`/`proc` are **fixed** (not `OQ-syntax`).

### 1.6.1 The classification — static purity, three keywords

Classify a definition by its **declared purity class** — a syntactic function of
its declared row `ρ_decl` (§1.4; `∅` when no `visits` is written), whether
it is a `space`/`becomes` operation (§4), and its count of **explicit value
parameters** `p`:

- **Impure** ⟺ `ρ_decl` is **non-empty**, **or** `ρ_decl` **contains a row
  variable** (§1.5), **or** the definition is a `space` operation. An impure
  definition is a **`proc`**, at **any** arity (including a nullary-effectful
  `proc now () : Instant visits [Clock]` and a row-polymorphic
  `proc traverse … visits [e]`).
- **Pure** ⟺ `ρ_decl = ∅` **and** not a `space` operation (whence the escape
  check, §1.4, forces the inferred row `ρ_inf = ∅` too — pure on *both* faces).
  A pure definition is:
  - a **`const`** if it has **zero explicit value parameters** — a pure value.
    By referential transparency a nullary pure "function" always yields the same
    value, so it *is* a constant (subsumes the pure top-level `let`/value, `33
    §1`).
  - an **`fn`** if it has **≥1 explicit value parameter** — a pure function the
    verification layer may treat as a mathematical function (§1, `../20-
    verification/`).

The split is **total**: every well-formed definition is exactly one of
`{const, fn, proc}`, because `{pure-nullary, pure-with-arguments, impure}`
partition every definition. And it is **decidable**: `ρ_decl` and the
`space`-op and arity facts are syntactic, and `ρ_inf` is the terminating
fixpoint of §1.3/§1.5.

**Effect-polymorphic ≠ pure (the crux that makes the split total).** A `proc`
whose row is a *variable* `[e]` is impure **even though** it type-checks + runs
**pure** when its callback is instantiated at the empty row: `traverse`
instantiated with a pure callback denotes to an effect-free tree, yet `traverse`
itself is a `proc`. It classifies the **abstraction's guarantee**, never
its best-case instantiation — `fn` promises purity *unconditionally*, which a
row-polymorphic definition cannot honour. This is why the polymorphic case lives
decisively on the `proc` side (§1.5, §2.2 crux).

### 1.6.2 The bidirectional check — the keyword cannot lie

The keyword is verified against **both** the signature and the body /
transitively-inferred effects; a disagreement in **either** direction is a
**hard error** (§1.6.3). Two directions, one already-landed gate underneath:

- **`fn`/`const` claims purity — the body must be pure.** Because `fn`/`const`
  carry **no `visits` clause** (`ρ_decl = ∅`), the existing escape check (§1.4)
  *is* this direction: any non-empty `ρ_inf` escapes `∅` and is rejected, naming
  the offending `perform`/call. So **"an `fn` that performs or transitively
  infers an effect is a compile error"** (AC1) is §1.4's pure-default gate — no
  new machinery; SURF-1 only *re-labels* it as the purity-signal guarantee.
- **`proc` claims impurity — the signature must earn it.** A `proc` whose
  declared row is empty and which is not a `space` op (so it is *provably pure*)
  is a **should-be-`fn`/`const`** mismatch. This is the genuinely new
  reverse-direction check: `proc` must carry a non-empty row, a row variable, or
  a `space` op. (A `proc` that declares `visits [FS]` yet whose body is now
  pure is **not** this — its declared row is non-empty, so `proc` is honest;
  declaring more than you use is the §1.4 headroom rule, a legitimate stable
  interface.)
- **Arity within the pure class.** A pure `fn` with **zero** explicit value
  parameters is a **should-be-`const`** mismatch; a `const` with **≥1** is a
  **should-be-`fn`** mismatch (`const` is the zero-parameter form).

The signal is reliable **only if it cannot lie** — so no direction is a silent
default; each mismatch is reported at the definition site.

**Instance-field witnesses — covariant subsumption, not exact match (DS-8b).**
The directions above govern a *definition's own* keyword; a class **instance**
supplying a witness for a field (`33 §5.2`) is checked by **subsumption**. A
**pure (`∅`-row) witness satisfies a `proc` field**: a `proc`'s contract is "may
be effectful," it may instantiate to `∅` (the §1.4 headroom — declaring more
than you use is legitimate), and a pure witness *is* that instantiation — a
more-precise inhabitant, `∅ ⊆ ρ_field`. Only the set of admissible witnesses
widens: the field's own classification is unchanged, and the Type/`Ω`
discriminant is untouched (`33 §5.2` AC4). The covariance is **one-way** — an
**effectful witness for a pure `fn`/`const` field still rejects** (a pure field
demands a pure witness), unchanged from the definition-site gate above.

### 1.6.3 Pinned sub-decisions (SURF-1 §5)

- **(a) Mismatch severity — HARD ERROR (pinned).** Every mismatch above — the
  `proc`-should-be-`fn`/`const` reverse direction and both arity mismatches — is
  a **compile error**, not a lint. Rationale, grounded in the reliable-signal
  requirement: a lint leaves the signal *advisory*, so a reader could not trust
  `fn`/`const`/`proc` to mean what it says without re-deriving the effect set —
  which defeats the entire point of moving purity from convention to a checked
  declaration. A reliable bidirectional signal requires the keyword and the
  static purity **cannot disagree in the accepted program**. (The `fn`-false-
  purity direction was already hard — the §1.4 escape error — so hard-error in
  both directions is the *consistent* choice, not a new severity.)
- **(b) "Zero parameter" counts explicit value parameters only (pinned).**
  `const` requires zero **explicit value** parameters; **implicit `{…}` binders
  do not count** — whether type (`{A : Type}`), level, instance (`{d : C A}`,
  `33 §5.4`), or row (`{e}`, §1.5). Grounded on `39 §2.2`: an implicit
  argument is **inserted and solved by the elaborator at each use site** (never
  written by the caller) and erased, so a definition whose only parameters are
  implicit is **used exactly as a constant** — `nil {A} : List A` is written
  `nil` at every occurrence, a polymorphic *constant family*, not a function one
  applies to a value. Forcing it to `fn` would misread "you apply this to an
  argument" onto something no caller ever applies. So `const nil {A : Type} :
  List A` is a `const`; `fn` begins at the first **explicit** value parameter.

### 1.6.4 `view` retired — role carry-over and kernel invariance

`view` and the top-level `let` value are **removed**; every role maps onto
the three keywords by the §1.6.1 rule:

| former `view`/`let` | becomes |
|---|---|
| pure value, 0 explicit value params (incl. top-level `let`) | `const` |
| pure function, ≥1 explicit value param | `fn` |
| concrete effect at any arity (incl. nullary, `space` op) | `proc` |
| effect-polymorphic (declares a row variable, §1.5) | `proc` |
| operator (symbolic name, `33 §6`) | `fn`/`proc` (or `const` if nullary-pure) |

The local `let … in …` **expression** (`32 §3`) is unaffected by this
*definition*-keyword split; its sequential binding-group behavior is specified
by §1.2 and §2.4.

**Kernel-untouched (AC5).** The classification is a surface keyword plus an
elaborator check layered over the existing row inference (§1.2–§1.5); it emits
the *same* core terms the kernel already checks (a pure definition still denotes
to a plain term via the §2.4 collapse; an effectful one to an `ITree`). No new
kernel rule, judgment, `Term`, or `Decl`; `trusted_base()` is byte-unchanged. A
misclassification is caught as a **surface error** — a rejected valid program or
a compile error — **never** an unsound acceptance (`39 §1`), the same
untrusted-elaborator posture as the rest of `36`.

## 2. The encoding — three layers, one pure kernel (`OQ-8` DECIDED)

An effect row is **not** a kernel primitive. The surface `Eff [E] A` monad
(`../50-stdlib/`) elaborates into a **pure** dependent term through three
layers, each answering a different question — and the *same denotation* powers
verification, capabilities, information flow, and Ward's behavioral export:

1. **Authority — "who may perform this effect?"** A **capability-passing**
   translation: performing an effect requires a **capability token** (a value)
   in scope; at the `../10-kernel/` level this is ordinary Π over capability
   tokens (§2.5, §3). Static and visible; no runtime gate.
2. **Denotation — "what does this computation *do*?"** The effectful computation
   denotes to an **interaction tree** (a free-monad-style *pure data structure*:
   `Ret a` | `perform e then continue with the response`). `Eff`'s bind is tree
   grafting. The kernel sees only this inductive datatype — it stays pure. One
   choice serves four masters: **handlers are folds** over the tree (§5);
   **Ward's event alphabet is the tree's `perform` nodes** (`../70-behavioral/
   §3`); **information-flow labels are labels on those nodes** (§3,
   `../60-security/61`); and **verification is predicates over the tree**.
3. **Specification — "what must it guarantee?"** `requires`/`ensures` on an
   effectful function are **WP/Hoare-style predicates over the denotation**. For
   *stateful* effects the pre/post relation is the genuinely hard part and is
   resolved by **`OQ-Space` DECIDED** (§4).

So effects are a **surface + elaborator + runtime** discipline; the kernel
reasons about a pure denotation and the runtime
(`../40-runtime/42-evaluation.md`) executes the real effects via the boundary.
The trusted base gains nothing — the same small-TCB invariant that governs the
rest of the kernel (ADR 0001/0004/0005). *(Precedents, one per layer: Koka rows
· Interaction Trees · F\* Dijkstra monads — read to understand, not copied.)*

### 2.1 The interaction tree (the pure kernel datatype)

An **effect signature** is a container: which operations exist and what response
each returns. It is an ordinary `record` (negative Σ with η, `../10-kernel/14
§4`, `13 §3`):

```
record Effect : Type (suc (max ℓ_op ℓ_resp)) where    -- level-poly in ℓ_op, ℓ_resp
  Op   : Type ℓ_op                  -- the operations of the effect
  Resp : Op → Type ℓ_resp           -- the response the runtime returns for each op
```

```
Console  :  Op = { Write String }              Resp (Write _) = Unit
State S  :  Op = { Get } ∪ { Put s | s : S }   Resp Get = S ;  Resp (Put _) = Unit
```

(`Op` is a small inductive of op-tags; `Write`/`Put` carry their argument as
constructor data.) The **interaction tree** over a signature `E` with result
`R`:

```
data ITree (E : Effect) (R : Type ℓ_R) : Type (max ℓ_R ℓ_op ℓ_resp) where
  Ret : R → ITree E R
  Vis : (e : E.Op) → (E.Resp e → ITree E R) → ITree E R
```

- `Ret r` — finished with value `r`.
- `Vis e k` — perform operation `e`, then **continue** with `k`, which maps the
  runtime's response `E.Resp e` to the rest of the tree. The continuation is a
  *function into the tree*, so the response is not yet known: this is the pure
  data for "perform `e`, then proceed."
- **It is a genuine strictly-positive inductive — sound, and adding no kernel
  primitive (no new TCB).** `Vis`'s recursive argument `E.Resp e → ITree E R` is
  strictly positive: the recursive occurrence is the *codomain* of a function
  type, the `W`-style branching shape (`14 §2`; the positivity algorithm `14
  §8.2` accepts it — `D` under a `+`-codomain).
- **Admitted as of K1.5 (`f037451`).** The `Vis` argument is a **Π-bound
  (W-style) recursive occurrence**; `K1.5` (`f037451`, merged) lifted the
  `check_no_pi_bound_recursive` gate and generates `elim_ITree` with a
  **Π-abstracted induction hypothesis** (`14 §3`, AC5 in
  `kernel/tests/k1p5_wstyle.rs`). `ITree`, `bind` (§2.2), the handlers (§5),
  the denotation (§2.4), and the §3.1 contract realization are now all
  **admitted and buildable**. This was a sequencing dependency, not a soundness
  gap: the positivity is genuine and `ITree` adds no trusted primitive.
- Ken is total, so the tree is a **finite inductive** value, not a coinductive
  one; genuinely nonterminating interaction is Ward's domain (§5,
  `../70-behavioral/`).

**Level reconciliation (`12 §2`, `14 §1`) — the level is *forced*, not chosen:**

- `Ret`'s argument `R : Type ℓ_R` ⇒ `ℓ_R ≤ ℓ_ITree`.
- `Vis`'s second argument is a Π from `E.Resp e : Type ℓ_resp` into `ITree E R :
  Type ℓ_ITree`; by Π-Form (`13 §1`) it lives at `Type (max ℓ_resp ℓ_ITree)`,
  which (a constructor argument must sit at the family level or below, `14 §1`)
  forces `ℓ_resp ≤ ℓ_ITree`. `E.Op : Type ℓ_op` forces `ℓ_op ≤ ℓ_ITree`.
- The least such level is `ℓ_ITree = max ℓ_R ℓ_op ℓ_resp` — the formation level
  above. **Predicative** (no universe is dropped, `12 §2`), **non-cumulative**
  (no implicit lift, `12 §3`): the elaborator emits the explicit level and the
  kernel re-checks it (`12 §4`). **Common case:** first-order effects with `Op`,
  `Resp` at level 0 and `R : Type 0` give `ITree E R : Type 0` — a small type in
  the same universe as the values it sequences.

### 2.2 ret, bind, perform

The `Eff` monad's operations are kernel terms over `ITree`:

```
ret : R → ITree E R
ret = Ret

perform : (e : E.Op) → ITree E (E.Resp e)            -- the one-operation tree
perform e = Vis e (λ r. Ret r)

bind : ITree E A → (A → ITree E B) → ITree E B        -- graft k onto every Ret leaf
bind (Ret a)   k = k a
bind (Vis e f) k = Vis e (λ r. bind (f r) k)
```

`bind` **grafts** `k` onto every leaf; it is defined by `elim_ITree` on its
first argument (the recursion is on the structural sub-tree `f r`), so it is
**total** (`14 §3`: ι-reduction terminates by structural decrease) and needs
**no SCT**. Explicitly, with motive `M _ = (A → ITree E B) → ITree E B`:

```
bind t k = elim_ITree M
             (λ a.       λ k. k a)                       -- Ret method
             (λ e f ih.  λ k. Vis e (λ r. ih r k))       -- Vis method;  ih r ≡ bind (f r)
             t k
```

The monad laws (left/right unit, associativity) hold **propositionally** by
`elim_ITree` (and definitionally where ι fires); they are *stated as
obligations*, not assumed (`14 §5`; the proof rides V1).

### 2.3 A row is one signature (`⊕`)

A row `ρ = {E₁,…,Eₙ}` is interpreted by **one** combined signature `⟦ρ⟧ = E₁ ⊕ …
⊕ Eₙ`, the disjoint union of containers:

```
(E ⊕ F) : Effect
  Op = E.Op + F.Op                                  -- binary coproduct (14)
  Resp (inl o) = E.Resp o ;  Resp (inr o) = F.Resp o
```

`⊕` is associative, commutative, and unital up to `Eq` with the **empty effect**
`𝟘` (`Op = Empty`, `14 §3`) as unit — the row's *set* structure (§1.1) denotes
to this signature algebra. Performing `Eᵢ` inside a ρ-computation is `perform`
after injecting `Eᵢ.Op ↪ ⟦ρ⟧.Op`. So a function of row `ρ` denotes into a
**single** pure tree `ITree ⟦ρ⟧ R` carrying every effect it may perform.

### 2.4 The denotation `⟦·⟧` (surface → pure tree)

An effectful surface expression `e` of type `B` and row `ρ` elaborates to a
kernel term `⟦e⟧ : ITree ⟦ρ⟧ ⟦B⟧`:

```
⟦ v ⟧                 = Ret ⟦v⟧                       -- a pure value / sub-expression
⟦ perform_E op ⟧      = Vis (inj_E op) (λ r. Ret r)   -- = perform (inj_E op)
⟦ let x = e1 in e2 ⟧  = bind ⟦e1⟧ (λ x. ⟦e2⟧)          -- monadic sequencing
⟦ let x = e1; y = e2; … in body ⟧
                         = bind ⟦e1⟧ (λ x. bind ⟦e2⟧ (λ y. … ⟦body⟧))
⟦ g a1 … an ⟧         = bind ⟦a1⟧ (λ x1. … bind ⟦an⟧ (λ xn.
                          incl_{ρ_g ↪ ρ} (g↓ caps x1 … xn)))   -- splice the callee's tree
⟦ if c then t else u ⟧ = bind ⟦c⟧ (λ b. elim_Bool _ ⟦t⟧ ⟦u⟧ b)
```

- `incl_{ρ_g ↪ ρ} : ITree ⟦ρ_g⟧ X → ITree ⟦ρ⟧ X` re-tags a callee's tree along
  the signature inclusion `⟦ρ_g⟧ ↪ ⟦ρ⟧` (well-defined because the escape check
  guarantees `ρ_g ⊆ ρ`, §1.4). It is itself an `elim_ITree` map over the `Vis`
  tags — pure. `g↓ caps …` is the callee's elaborated kernel term, taking its
  capability parameters (§2.5).
- A **pure** `fn`/`const` (`ρ = ∅`) denotes to `ITree 𝟘 ⟦B⟧`. No `Vis` node is
  constructible (`𝟘.Op = Empty` is uninhabited), so `ITree 𝟘 ⟦B⟧ ≅ ⟦B⟧` and the
  elaborator **collapses** it to the plain term `⟦B⟧`: pure code pays nothing
  for the encoding and the kernel sees an ordinary term. This is the formal
  content of "purity is the default and free."

The grouped equation is the source list's left-to-right monadic sequence: each
RHS tree is bound exactly once, its result extends the environment seen by the
next continuation, and the body is last. It is definitionally the repeated
application of the one-binding equation, hence identical to the explicitly
nested spelling. Grouping never hoists an RHS across another binding, a lambda,
a match branch, or a handler; branch-local effects remain branch-local.

### 2.5 Capability-passing (the authority layer)

The denotation says *what* a computation does; the capability layer says *who
may make it do that*. Performing an effect requires a **capability token** in
scope:

```
Cap : Effect → Type ℓ_op           -- the authority to perform E's operations
```

`Cap E` is an authority value — minted by a handler (§5) and threaded by
ordinary Π/λ; its internals (attenuation, revocation) live in
`../60-security/62`. The elaboration is a **capability-passing translation**: a
function of row `ρ` takes one capability per **un-handled** effect of `ρ` as an
extra leading parameter —

```
proc f (x:A) : B visits ρ
  ⤳  f↓ : (caps : Π_{E ∈ ρ_open} Cap E) → ⟦A⟧ → ITree ⟦ρ⟧ ⟦B⟧
```

where `ρ_open` are the effects **not** provided by an enclosing handler (§5). A
`perform_E op` is well-formed only if `Cap E` is in scope; otherwise it is a
**missing-capability** error (§7.3). At the kernel level this is **ordinary Π/λ
over the `Cap E` values** — no new construct, exactly the small-TCB invariant
(`12`, ADR 0001/0004). The surface `using c : Cap E` (§3) names a capability
parameter explicitly; the row machinery threads the rest.

This is where the layers meet: the **row** is the static type-level manifest
(§1), the **capability** is the value-level authority (§2.5/§3), the **tree** is
the pure denotation the kernel checks (§2.1–2.4) — three layers, one pure
kernel.

## 3. Capabilities (`requires`-as-capability)

Distinct from logical preconditions (`../20-verification/21 §1`), a
**capability** is an authority token a computation must be *given* to act (open
a file, hit the network). Ken keeps the two readings of `requires` distinct:

- **Logical `requires φ`** — a proposition, discharged by proof
  (`../20-verification/21 §1`).
- **Capability `using c : Cap`** — a value-level authority, passed explicitly or
  via the effect row, enabling the corresponding effect. Capabilities make the
  *principle of least authority* expressible: a function gets exactly the
  capabilities it needs, visible in its type.

**`OQ-8a` DECIDED (operator, 2026-06-27): capabilities are first-class value
tokens, not a separate effect kind and not a runtime gate.** A capability is a
*value* (`c : Cap E`, §2.5) threaded explicitly or supplied by an enclosing
handler (a handler is a capability provider, §5); authority is **static and
visible** in the type, **attenuable** and **revocable** with use audited
(`../60-security/62`). It is kept distinct from the logical `requires φ` (a
proposition); a capability is an authority, a precondition is a proof
obligation, and Ken never conflates them.

### 3.1 The effect-row / capability interface (cross-workstream contract)

Sec1/Sec1ct/Sec2 (`../60-security/`) and B1 (`../70-behavioral/`) build **on top
of** this interface, so its shape is a **fixed contract**, not an implementation
detail. The contract surface:

| Surface form | Kernel denotation | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| latent row `A →[ρ] B` | the `Vis`-tags reachable in `ITree ⟦ρ⟧ B` | escape check §1; B1 alphabet |
| effect label `E` | a summand `E.Op ↪ ⟦ρ⟧.Op` (§2.3) | IFC label site §3; Ward node |
| capability `Cap E` | a value parameter (Π, §2.5) | Sec2 authority; attenuation `62` |
| IFC label `@ℓ` on a channel | a label index on the `Vis` op/resp | Sec1 flow check `61` |
| `@ct` taint | a label whose sink is a distinguished `Vis` op | Sec1ct `61 §5a` |

The three load-bearing guarantees the consumers may rely on:

1. **Manifest-in-the-type.** A function's effects, labels, and capabilities are
   recoverable from its *type* — the latent row plus capability parameters —
   never only from its body.
2. **Every authority-relevant act is a `Vis` node.** Ward's event alphabet and
   the IFC/`@ct` sinks are *exactly* the tree's `perform` sites — nothing
   effectful hides between nodes.
3. **Discharge is visible.** A handler (§5) is the **only** way to remove an
   effect/label/authority from a row, and it shows in the row (`ρ \ {E}`, §1.2).

Consumers may **index** a `Vis` node (labels, clearance, ct-taint) but must
**not** add a kernel primitive — labels ride the existing container. *(This
interface is raised to the Architect as the L5 cross-workstream contract before
the Sec/B WPs build on it.)*

### 3.2 Security extension (tier-1, `../60-security/`)

The effect/capability discipline is the host for two security mechanisms (ADR
0004):

- **Information-flow labels.** Effect channels (`Net`, `FS`, a log, a `space`
  cell) carry a **clearance label**, and data carries a security label; writing
  data `@ ℓ` to a sink of clearance `κ` type-checks only when `ℓ ⊑ κ`. The same
  indexed-effect machinery that indexes capabilities here indexes **labels** —
  this is how Ken gets **intrinsic information-flow control** without a new
  kernel primitive (`../60-security/61-information-flow.md`).
- **Attenuation + revocation.** Capabilities are **attenuable** (derive a
  strictly weaker token for a child) and **revocable** at a boundary, with use
  audited — the principle-of-least-authority story
  (`../60-security/62-authority.md`).
- **Constant-time (`@ct`) — leakage-relevant operations as an effect sink.** A
  distinct, **opt-in** timing-sensitive label `@ct` (separate from `Secret`
  confidentiality) marks data whose *influence* must not reach a **leakage-
  relevant operation** — a secret-dependent **branch guard**, **memory index**,
  or **variable-time primitive**. Those operations are a distinguished **effect
  sink**, and the rule is the IFC rule reused: a `@ct` value reaching such a
  sink is a **type error** (you cannot leak by accident; no per-operation
  annotation). This **unary taint discipline soundly enforces the source-level
  constant-time (2-safety) property** — no relational/product-program machinery.
  The sensitive *range* is the `@ct` label's live span (intro → `declassify`),
  so there is **no `constant_time { … }` region**; a function carries a
  **signature-level CT promise** (constant-time in a parameter) for boundary
  checking and export. The *timing guarantee itself* is
  codegen/hardware-relative and **delegated to `Ward`** under a stated leakage
  model (`../60-security/61 §5a`, `64 §4.2`, `63 §5a`); a **policy** may require
  `@ct` for a data class (`../60-security/65`).

So a function's effect-and-capability type is simultaneously its **capability
manifest** and its **flow manifest**. Details, the label lattice,
declassification, and the constant-time discipline are in `../60-security/`.

## 4. State — the `space` model

Pure code cannot mutate. Genuine mutable state and process isolation live in a
**`space`** — a unit of encapsulated mutable state and isolation defined by its
*semantics* (cells, ordered effectful operations), not by any particular
OS-level implementation:

```
space Counter {
  mut n : Int = 0
  proc inc () : Unit  visits [Counter] = n becomes n + 1
  proc get () : Int   visits [Counter] = n
}
```

- A `space` encapsulates **cells** (`mut`) with identity; operations on it carry
  the space as an effect. Mutation is `becomes` (cell update). Reads/writes are
  ordered by the effect discipline. Semantically, `becomes` denotes to a
  **state-passing fold** of the interaction tree (§4.2), imperative surface,
  functional denotation.
- A `space` is the **only** place identity-bearing mutable state exists; pure
  values are immutable. Closure-free canonical data has deterministic bytes at
  durable boundaries, while its in-process storage is private. Ordinary
  closures and graphs containing them are runtime-local and opaque
  (`../40-runtime/41-values.md §2.1`).

State has **two surfaces over one denotation**: the imperative `space` block
(§4.1–§4.4) and the direct monadic `[State s]` effect — `get`/`put`/`run_state`
(§4.5). Both desugar to the same `State S` signature (§2.1) and are discharged
by the same `run_state` fold (§4.2); the second is what a stateful computation
writes when there is no `space` to hang cells on (`OQ-C`·C2, §4.5).

### 4.1 A space desugars to a `State` effect

A `space` with cells `(c₁ : T₁) … (c_m : T_m)` desugars to:

- a **state type** `S = T₁ × … × T_m` (right-nested Σ / record, `13 §3`, with η
  so cell update reconstructs definitionally);
- a **state effect** `State S` (§2.1): `Op = Get | Put S`, `Resp Get = S`, `Resp
  (Put _) = Unit`;
- **one effect label** for the space; every operation `visits [<space>]` uses
  `State S`.

Cell access elaborates (cell `cᵢ` is component `i` of `S`):

```
cᵢ            (read cell i)    ⤳  bind (perform Get) (λ s. Ret (s.i))
cᵢ becomes e  (write cell i)   ⤳  bind (perform Get) (λ s. perform (Put (s with .i := ⟦e⟧)))
```

`s with .i := v` is the record/Σ update reusing every other component (`13 §3`
η). So `becomes` is **not** a kernel mutation — it is a `Get`-then-`Put` on the
pure tree.

### 4.2 The state-passing fold (`run_state`)

A space's effect is discharged by **running the tree against an initial state**
— the canonical tail-resumptive handler (§5), a fold that threads `s` as its
accumulator:

```
run_state : S → ITree (State S ⊕ F) R → ITree F (R × S)
run_state s (Ret r)                = Ret (r, s)
run_state s (Vis (inl Get)      k) = run_state s  (k s)            -- answer with current state
run_state s (Vis (inl (Put s')) k) = run_state s' (k tt)          -- adopt new state
run_state s (Vis (inr o)        k) = Vis o (λ r. run_state s (k r))  -- other effects pass through
```

- It is `elim_ITree` with the **state carried in the motive** `M _ = S → ITree F
  (R × S)` — a structural fold, **total** (`14 §3`). The continuation `k` is
  invoked **exactly once, in tail position** in every clause, so it is
  tail-resumptive (§5) and no continuation is reified.
- `run_state s₀ ⟦body⟧ : ITree F (R × S)` returns the result paired with the
  **final** state; when `F = 𝟘` it collapses (§2.4) to the pure value `(R × S)`.
  So a space operation's denotation is a **state transformer** `S → R × S`. The
  kernel checks this pure term; **no mutable cell exists in the TCB**.

### 4.3 Bounded Hoare and `old`

`requires`/`ensures` on a space operation are **predicates over its
state-transformer denotation** `S → R × S` (`../20-verification/21 §1`, §2 layer
3):

- `requires φ` constrains the **pre-state** `s_pre : S` (and parameters);
- `ensures ψ` relates `s_pre`, the `result`, and the **post-state** `s_post`;
- **`old(e)`** denotes `e` evaluated in `s_pre` (`21 §4`) — well-defined because
  the denotation *names* the pre-state. A bare cell `cᵢ` in `ensures` is the
  post-state value; `old(cᵢ)` is the pre-state value.

Because each space's `S` is **encapsulated and non-aliased** (shared-nothing,
§4.4), the obligation is **local, bounded, per-space Hoare** over `S` — **no
separation logic, no frame rule, no global `\old`** (`21 §4`, `OQ-Space`).
Worked example: `inc`'s `ensures n == old(n) + 1` denotes to the transformer `λ
s. (tt, s with .n := s.n + 1)` and the obligation `(s with .n := s.n + 1).n ==
s.n + 1`, which computes (record-β / η, `13 §3`) to `s.n + 1 == s.n + 1` —
discharged by `refl` (`16 §2`).

### 4.4 Concurrency & isolation — shared-nothing (`OQ-Space` DECIDED)

For *in-Ken* communication, spaces are **shared-nothing**: they share no mutable
memory and communicate only by passing immutable, closure-free value graphs
(actor-style). At a durable message boundary, admitted values in the durably
canonicalizable domain use deterministic canonical bytes. Proved `Map`/`Set`
package trees instead preserve extensional equality, ordered `to_list`, and
durable round-trip; their internal bytes are not observable (`41 §3a`). An
ordinary closure nested at any depth is rejected before publication (`41
§2.1`).
Live-domain invocation across artifacts is a distinct non-serialized boundary;
it does not permit messaging a closure through this path. Isolation is
therefore a **guarantee**, not a discipline — no shared mutable state ⇒ no data
races — on which capability revocation and confinement rest
(`../60-security/62 §4`, ADR 0004). Physical copying, sharing, interning, and
storage ownership are private runtime choices and do not weaken this
no-shared-mutable-authority guarantee (`../40-runtime/44 §1a`). This pairs with
the rest of the model: a
space handle is a **capability** (§3), send/receive are **effects** (§2),
messages carry **IFC labels** (§3), and message events are **Ward's behavioral
alphabet** (`../70-behavioral/`). The **runtime realization** — process, thread,
green-thread, or distributed — is deferred to `../40-runtime/` (the *model* is
shared-nothing; the *mapping* is an implementation choice,
distribution-ready). *(FFI is the exception: a `foreign` boundary may use
shared memory, but it is already an explicitly unsafe/untrusted boundary,
`38-ffi-io.md §3`, so it does not weaken the in-Ken isolation property.)*

### 4.5 The direct `[State s]` effect surface (`get`/`put`/`run_state`)

Sections §4.1–§4.2 give the **imperative** door to state — a `space` block whose
`mut`/`becomes` desugar to `State S` and discharge by `run_state`. This section
adds the **monadic** door: writing `get`/`put`/`run_state` **directly** as a
first-class effect — the shape a stateful computation like `accumulator-factory`
(VAL2 #10) needs when there is no `space` to hang cells on. It introduces **no
new denotation**: both surfaces desugar to the *same* `State S` signature (§2.1)
and are discharged by the *same* `run_state` fold (§4.2); §4.5 only **exposes**
that machinery as named operations. **`OQ-C` DECIDED (operator, 2026-07-03):**
this is **C2** — an effect over the existing `ITree`/handler machinery; **C1**
(explicit state-threading) is the floor it desugars to (§4.5.6); **C3** (real
mutable refs/cells/regions) is **forbidden** — no memory is mutated.

#### 4.5.1 The state type parameterizes the row

The row lattice (§1.1) is a finite set of atomic effect **labels**. `State s` is
a **type-indexed** label: `State Int` and `State Bool` are *distinct* labels. A
program instantiates `State` at **finitely many** concrete state types, so the
label set `𝓔` stays finite and §1.3's terminating least-fixpoint inference is
preserved unchanged — the type index rides the label; it does not make the
lattice infinite.

This mirrors §4.1 exactly: a `space` already contributes **one label per
space**, bound to that space's state type `S`. The direct surface simply lets a
program **name** `State s` in a `visits` row without introducing a `space`. A
single `[State s]` is the common case; two *independent* states in one
computation are two *distinct* labels (as two spaces are), peeled by nested
`run_state` calls (§4.5.4).

#### 4.5.2 `get` and `put`

The two operations of `State s` (§2.1: `Op = Get | Put s`, `Resp Get = s`,
`Resp (Put _) = Unit`), surfaced as first-class effectful producers — each a
`perform` (§2.2) on the row signature:

```
get : Unit →[{State s}] s     get ()  ⤳  perform (inj Get)      = Vis (inj Get)      (λ r. Ret r)
put : s   →[{State s}] Unit    put s'  ⤳  perform (inj (Put s'))  = Vis (inj (Put s')) (λ _. Ret tt)
```

- `s` is an ordinary (implicit) type parameter of each operation, fixed at a use
  site by the enclosing `run_state`'s initial state `s₀ : s` (§4.5.3) or by
  annotation.
- `Resp Get = s` is a **non-`Unit`, `s`-typed** response — `State s` is the
  first effect whose response *depends on* a type parameter (Console's is always
  `Unit`). This dependence is already §2.1/§7.4 normative; §4.5.6 notes it is
  the forcing function for the landed code.
- `inj : (State s).Op ↪ ⟦ρ⟧.Op` is the row-signature injection (§2.3); in a
  single-`State s` row `⟦{State s}⟧ = State s` and `inj` is the identity.
- Surface *spelling* (`[State s]`, `get`, `put`) is proposal-level
  (`OQ-syntax`); the **operations and their denotations are normative** — they
  are §2.1's `Get`/`Put` under §2.2's `perform`. An effectful producer
  `Unit →[ρ] a` denotes to `ITree ⟦ρ⟧ a` (§1.1, §2.4), the form §4.2/§4.5.3
  use.

#### 4.5.3 `run_state` is §4.2's fold at `F = 𝟘` — not re-specified

`run_state` is **exactly** the state-passing `elim_ITree` fold of §4.2; §4.5 does
**not** restate its equations. The direct surface exposes it as the
program-callable handler that discharges `State s`:

```
run_state : s → ITree (State s ⊕ F) a → ITree F (a × s)      -- §4.2, verbatim
run_state s₀ m  :  a × s        when F = ∅   -- pure collapse: ITree 𝟘 (a × s) ≅ a × s (§2.4)
```

- The result pair `a × s` is `(result, final-state)` — the **Σ-pair** `R × S`
  that §4.2 returns (`(r, s)`, a right-nested Σ / record with η, `13 §3`),
  realized at runtime by the interpreter's `EvalVal::Pair` (`ken-interp`). This
  denotation uses raw dependent-pair syntax and the kernel term constructor; it
  does not assume ambient availability of the named standard-package `Pair`.
  Source that chooses the equivalent named `Pair a s` spelling imports its
  canonical interface (`34 §"Canonical non-dependent pair package"`). A named
  inductive `data Prod a b = MkProd a b` is a distinct checked convenience
  outside the strict floor; the denotation uses neither that identity nor an
  ambient fallback.
- **`run_state` is an ordinary *total Ken definition*** — the §4.2 fold,
  structural on the sub-tree via `elim_ITree`, kernel-re-checked — **not** a
  trusted Rust primitive. This is what makes `[State s]`
  **zero-`trusted_base` delta** (AC1): the handler is *derived*, never
  *postulated*. The runtime merely *evaluates* it (call-by-need over the pure
  tree, `../40-runtime/42`); it is **not** an I/O driver like Console's `run_io`
  (§7.2), because pure state threading performs no I/O.
- Worked `accumulator-factory` (VAL2 #10) — a post-increment `next` that returns
  the current value and bumps the state:
  `next () = bind (get ()) (λ n. bind (put (n + 1)) (λ _. Ret n))`.

  ```
  run_state 0  next  =  (0, 1)     -- result = old value 0 ; final state 1 ; pair = (result, state)
  run_state 41 next  =  (41, 42)
  ```

  The result is a **function of `s₀` and the pure tree alone** — re-running the
  same tree under a fresh `s₀` re-threads from scratch (§4.5.5); result `0` ≠
  state `1` pins the pair *order* `(result, state)` (§4.2).

#### 4.5.4 Composition with other effects

`[State s]` composes with any other row `F` by the row signature `⊕` (§2.3): a
program that is both `[State s]` and `[Console]` denotes to
`ITree (State s ⊕ Console) a`. `run_state s₀` discharges the `State s` summand by
its **`inl`** clauses (§4.2) and **passes every other op through** by the
**`Vis (inr o)`** clause (§4.2's fourth line), leaving `ITree Console (a × s)`;
a Console handler — the runtime `run_io` driver (§7.2, `../40-runtime/42`) —
then discharges the rest.

- **Handler nesting = discharge order.** `run_state s₀ (handleConsole m)` and
  `handleConsole (run_state s₀ m)` differ only in *which effect is peeled first*;
  both type-check, and the threaded state is **identical** because `run_state`
  passes Console ops through untouched and `handleConsole` never reads `State`
  ops. `State s` and `Console` **commute** (neither handler inspects the other's
  `Vis` tags) — a discriminating conformance check (§7.5.6).
- **Independent multiple states.** Two independent states in one computation are
  two *distinct* labels `State s`, `State t` (§4.5.1); nest `run_state` calls,
  the inner binding the inner state — nested total folds, no new mechanism.

#### 4.5.5 Purity and totality (frame AC3)

The purity/totality argument is §4.2's, applied to the direct surface:

- **Total.** `run_state` is a structural `elim_ITree` fold with the state carried
  in the motive `M _ = S → ITree F (R × S)` (§4.2), and each clause invokes the
  continuation **once, in tail position** (tail-resumptive, §5.2) — so it stays
  inside the total eliminator and reifies no continuation. `get`/`put` build
  finite pure `Vis` nodes (§2.1).
- **No mutable cell exists.** The state is `run_state`'s **parameter**, threaded
  functionally; the effect **erases** to its `ITree` description (§2.4). Nowhere
  on the value path is a cell, ref, or region introduced — the C2/C3 boundary
  the WP must preserve (frame AC3; grep: no `RefCell`/`Cell`/`unsafe`/interior
  mutability on the value path).
- **The discriminating face** (state-threaded-in-parameter vs mutated-in-place):
  a `[State s]` program's result is determined **entirely by `run_state`'s `s₀`
  and the pure tree**. Running the *same tree* under two initial states yields
  two independent results with **no shared mutable state** between the runs, so
  `run_state s₀ m` is **re-runnable and idempotent in `m`**. In-place mutation
  would let one run's writes leak into the next; the pure fold cannot (§7.5.6
  pins this as the C3-forbidden guard).

#### 4.5.6 Relation to C1 (the floor) and the outer-ring code lift

- **C1-desugaring (the locked floor).** `[State s]` is **sugar over explicit
  state-threading** (C1): `run_state`'s fold *is* the mechanical "thread `s` as
  an extra argument and result" that C1 writes by hand, and `get`/`put` are its
  packaged read/write. So every `[State s]` program **desugars to** a C1
  program — the operator's "C1 is the floor" lock (`OQ-C`). No mutation is
  introduced (C3 forbidden): the entire surface is
  `perform`/`bind`/`elim_ITree` over the pure tree.
- **Build note — the outer-ring lift `[State s]` forces (no kernel change).**
  The landed *runnable* `ITree` (`prelude.rs`) is **Console-hardwired** —
  `data ITree r = Ret r | Vis ConsoleOp (Unit → ITree r)`, a fixed `Unit`
  response and no effect parameter. `[State s]` is the **forcing function** to
  lift three simplifications already flagged in-code as downstream work, up to
  the §2/§4 model: **(a)** the **dependent response** `E.Resp e` (`State s`
  needs `Resp Get = s`, non-`Unit`); **(b)** the container coproduct **`⊕`** for
  `State s ⊕ F` (composition, §4.5.4); **(c)** **named-effect dispatch** so
  `run_state` peels `State` and passes other ops through. All three are
  §36-normative and admitted by K1.5's generic `elim_ITree`
  (`kernel/tests/k1p5_wstyle.rs`) — **the kernel is untouched** (AC1). The work
  is entirely outer-ring: `ken-elaborator/src/effects/*` + `ken-interp` + a
  **derived** stdlib `run_state`; no new `Term`/`Decl` variant, no
  `trusted_base()` delta.

#### 4.5.7 Injection into a coproduct — the surface morphism (`incl`, named)

§4.5.4 discharges a composed tree by **peeling** one summand (`run_state`) and
passing the rest through; it presumes a tree *already* over `State s ⊕ F`. The
dual — **getting a single-effect computation's ops *into* the coproduct** — is
§2.3's `inj` / §2.4's `incl` (`ITree ⟦ρ_g⟧ X → ITree ⟦ρ⟧ X`, an `elim_ITree`
map over the `Vis` tags), which the **direct surface exposes as named
injection operations** for the binary signature `Coproduct g h`, exactly as §4.5.2
exposes `get`/`put` and §4.5.3 exposes `run_state`:

```
inject_l : ITree g rg a -> ITree (Coproduct g h) (resp_coproduct g h rg rh) a   -- re-tag via InL
inject_r : ITree h rh a -> ITree (Coproduct g h) (resp_coproduct g h rg rh) a   -- re-tag via InR
```

- **Denotation (normative):** the `elim_ITree` fold sending `Ret x ↦ Ret x` and
  `Vis op k ↦ Vis (InL op) (inject_l ∘ k)` (resp. `InR`), structural on the
  sub-tree — total (`14 §3`), no SCT, adds no kernel primitive. It is `§2.4`'s
  `incl` specialized to the two inclusions `g ↪ Coproduct g h`, `h ↪ Coproduct g h`.
- **Well-typed iff** the response family reduces per-tag: `resp_coproduct g h rg rh
  (InL o) ≡ rg o`, `(InR o) ≡ rh o` (§2.3 `Resp (inl o) = E.Resp o`) — so the
  re-tagged continuation keeps its response type.
- **Surface *spelling* (`inject_l`/`inject_r`) is proposal-level (`OQ-syntax`);
  the operation and its denotation are normative.** A program composes two base
  effects by injecting each single-effect sub-computation, then sequencing with
  `bind` (`ITree (Coproduct g h) …` is homogeneous). This is the **direct/monadic
  door**; the eventual sugar is the row-directed elaboration inserting `incl`
  automatically from a `visits [E, F]` row (§2.4), of which this is the floor —
  as C1 threading (§4.5.6) is the floor under `[State s]`. Realization + the
  D1/D3 couplings: `docs/program/wp/effect-composition.md` (D2).

## 5. Handlers — tail-resumptive only (`OQ-8`/`OQ-9` DECIDED)

A **handler** interprets an effect — operationally, a **fold over the
interaction tree** (§2 layer 2). Handlers are how user-defined effects are given
meaning and how capabilities are provided (a handler is a capability provider,
§3).

### 5.1 A handler is a fold (`elim_ITree`)

A handler for effect `E` interprets each `E`-operation, turning a tree over `E ⊕
F` into a tree over `F` — **discharging `E`** from the row. It is exactly
`elim_ITree` with two methods:

```
handle : (ret : R → ITree F R')                                       -- Ret leaf ↦ result
         (ops : (e : E.Op) → (E.Resp e → ITree F R') → ITree F R')    -- Vis node ↦ interpretation
       → ITree (E ⊕ F) R → ITree F R'
handle ret ops (Ret r)         = ret r
handle ret ops (Vis (inl e) k) = ops e (λ r. handle ret ops (k r))    -- interpret E-op, recurse on resume
handle ret ops (Vis (inr o) k) = Vis o (λ r. handle ret ops (k r))    -- F-op passes through
```

- The recursion is structural on the sub-tree `k r` ⇒ `elim_ITree`, **total**
  (`14 §3`), no SCT.
- The handler **provides the capability**: the body that produced the `E`-node
  was elaborated with `Cap E` in scope, supplied by this handler (§2.5). Running
  the handler discharges `E` (§1.2, `handle_E`) — which is why the *only* way to
  shrink a row is to handle it. `run_state` (§4.2) is the canonical instance (`R'
  = R × S`, `ops` threading Get/Put).

### 5.2 Tail-resumptive = the continuation is used once, in tail position

`OQ-9` restricts `ops` so that, in each clause, the resume function `λ r. handle
… (k r)` is invoked **at most once and in tail position**: a handler may
*resume* (pass a response and continue) or *stop* (return an `ITree F R'`
without resuming), but it cannot resume twice or capture the resumption as a
first-class value.

This is what keeps `handle` a **plain structural catamorphism** (`elim_ITree`):
with single tail resumption the fold never reifies or duplicates the
continuation, so it stays inside the total eliminator and **preserves totality**
(`../10-kernel/17 §4`, the SCT/termination story) — single-shot is a *proof
simplification*, not a hedge.

**Reified, multi-shot continuations** (`shift`/`reset`, `with multishot`) are
**excluded — a positive design choice, not a hedge** (`OQ-9` DECIDED): the
expressiveness they are reached for is **already subsumed** — generators via
`visits [Yield]` (`37 §3`), nondeterminism/backtracking as **search-as-data**
folded by total recursion, async/concurrency via the **seam** (`OQ-Space`,
§4.4), and delimited control captured *denotationally* by the interaction tree
itself (§2). What multishot uniquely adds — first-class dynamic `call/cc` — is
unpredictable, **complicates** proofs (it breaks the single-consumption WP
reasoning over the tree), and is costly to compile, cutting against every Ken
commitment; it returns only as a research footnote if a concrete unsubsumable
need appears. Genuinely reactive/nonterminating interaction is Ward's domain
(`../70-behavioral/`, `OQ-coinduction`).

## 6. What WS-L must deliver here (L5)

The deliverable is the elaboration above, made implementation-ready. Each item
is now a concrete, codeable section; an implementer builds from these and the
kernel re-checks the emitted core (the elaborator is **not** in the TCB, §7):

1. **Static effect row + inference** — the row lattice and latent-effect arrows
   (§1.1), transitive `infer_row` (§1.2), the call-graph least-fixpoint for
   recursion (§1.3), and the declared-row escape check (§1.4). *Acceptance 1.*
2. **Pure-kernel encoding** — the `ITree` datatype with its forced level (§2.1),
   `ret`/`bind`/`perform` (§2.2), the row signature `⊕` (§2.3), and the
   denotation `⟦·⟧` collapsing pure code (§2.4). The kernel checks the pure tree
   with no effect machinery. **Admitted as of K1.5 (`f037451`).**
   *Acceptance 2.*
3. **Capabilities** — `Cap E` and the capability-passing translation (§2.5), the
   `requires`-as-capability distinction (§3), and the pinned cross-workstream
   interface contract (§3.1). *Acceptance 3.*
4. **`space` state** — desugaring to a `State S` effect with `becomes` (§4.1),
   the `run_state` state-passing fold (§4.2), bounded Hoare with `old` (§4.3),
   and shared-nothing message-passing (§4.4); the **direct `[State s]` surface**
   — `get`/`put`/`run_state` as first-class operations over the same machinery
   (§4.5, `OQ-C`·C2). *Acceptance 4.*
5. **Tail-resumptive handlers** — handler-as-fold (§5.1) and the single-shot
   restriction with its totality argument (§5.2). *Acceptance 4.*
6. **The `pure`/`impure` boundary hook** for L7 to wire FFI into (§7.2).
   *Acceptance 5.*

Conformance: `../../conformance/surface/effects/` (§7.5).

## 7. Elaboration pipeline, boundary, and checks

### 7.0 Dependency — RESOLVED at K1.5 (`f037451`)

The denotation (§2) rests on the `ITree` inductive, whose `Vis` constructor is a
**Π-bound (W-style) recursive occurrence** (§2.1). **K1.5 merged at `f037451`**
and lifted the `check_no_pi_bound_recursive` gate; `elim_ITree` with a
Π-abstracted induction hypothesis is now generated (`14 §3`, AC5 in
`kernel/tests/k1p5_wstyle.rs`). All of §2 is now buildable:

- **Unblocked:** the `ITree` type, `bind`, `perform`, §5 (handlers/`run_state`),
  the denotation `⟦·⟧`, and the §3.1 contract any Sec/B WP rides — all admitted
  and implemented in `ken-elaborator/src/effects/itree.rs` and `row_poly.rs`.
- **Always buildable (K1-only row machinery):** the finite-row lattice and latent
  arrows (§1.1), `infer_row` and the call-graph least-fixpoint (§1.2–1.3), the
  §1.4 escape check, and the `⊕` row algebra (§2.3) remain ordinary static
  analyses; they need no kernel feature (unchanged from L5-build).

This was a **sequencing dependency, not a soundness gap** — the encoding was
always sound; it simply required a kernel feature (`K1.5`) that is now in.

### 7.1 Pipeline (surface → pure kernel term)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  src["surface decl<br/>proc … visits ρ"] --> parse["parse + resolve<br/>(31, 32, 39 §5)"]
  parse --> rows["row inference §1.2<br/>+ escape check §1.4"]
  rows --> caps["capability-passing §2.5"]
  caps --> den["denotation ⟦·⟧ → ITree §2.4"]
  den --> core["pure kernel term<br/>Π / Σ / inductive / ITree"]
  core --> kc["kernel check 18 §3<br/>(NO effect machinery)"]
```

The kernel step sees only Π/Σ/inductive/`ITree` — **no effect-specific rule**
(the "one pure kernel" invariant, acceptance criterion 2). Everything
effect-shaped is discharged before the kernel: rows by inference, authority by Π
over `Cap`, do-notation by `bind`, mutation by `run_state`.

### 7.2 The pure/impure boundary (the L7 FFI hook)

- `pure` ≡ the **empty row**; `impure` ≡ a **non-empty row** (`38 §2`). A
  `foreign` declaration carries a mandatory effect row (`38`); its operations
  are the **`Vis` nodes at the world frontier**.
- **The hook L7 plugs into:** the runtime supplies a **real-world handler** for
  each I/O effect (`FS`, `Net`, `Clock`, …) — the same `handle` shape (§5.1),
  but its `ops` perform actual side effects in the evaluator
  (`../40-runtime/42-evaluation.md`) instead of returning a pure `ITree`. **L5
  fixes the interface** — the effect signatures (`Op`/`Resp`) and that every
  foreign op is a `perform` (a `Vis` node) — and exposes it; **L7 provides the
  interpreters**. So L5 ↔ L7 couple at exactly the `Effect`-signature +
  `Vis`-node contract, nothing else.
- **Two readings of `pure` on a `foreign`, kept distinct by `pure ≡ empty
  row`:** a **fully-opaque `pure` foreign** (declares *no* row) is the **trusted
  postulate** — an *unchecked claim* confined to that boundary (`38 §3`), listed
  in the trusted base and **allowed**. A `foreign` that declares a **non-empty**
  row yet is tagged `pure` is **self-contradictory** (`pure` *is* the empty row)
  and is **rejected** — the boundary case of the §1.4 escape error, pinned by
  §7.5 case 5 (`impure`-masquerading-as-`pure`). The `foreign`-specific
  trusted-postulate rule itself is `38`/L7's; L5 settles only this
  escape-at-the-boundary.

### 7.3 Error classes (caught at elaboration, before the kernel)

1. **Effect escape** — `ρ_inf ⊄ ρ_decl`; names each escaping `E` and a witness
   perform/call (§1.4). *(Undeclared effect = compile error — acceptance 1.)*
2. **Missing capability** — a `perform_E` with no `Cap E` in scope and no
   enclosing handler for `E` (§2.5). *(Acceptance 3 denial path.)*
3. **Non-tail-resumptive handler** — `ops` resumes more than once, or not in
   tail position, or captures the resumption (§5.2). *(`OQ-9`.)*
4. **Mutation outside a space** — `becomes` on a non-cell, or a `mut` outside a
   `space` (§4).
5. **Ill-typed op / response** — a `perform e` whose response use disagrees with
   `E.Resp e`, or a `space` op whose `ensures` is not `: Ω` (`21 §4`).

All are surface diagnostics; the emitted core is then re-checked by the kernel —
the elaborator is **not** trusted (same posture as V0, `39 §5`). A
mis-elaboration that stays well-typed but mis-resolves is the residual risk the
conformance corpus (§7.5) targets with discriminating cases.

### 7.4 Level reconciliation (the soundness check)

| Construct | Level | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `Effect {ℓ_op, ℓ_resp}` | `Type (suc (max ℓ_op ℓ_resp))` | record / Σ-Form (`13 §2`) |
| `E ⊕ F` | same shape (`max` of parts) | coproduct of `Op`s (`14`) |
| `ITree E (R : Type ℓ_R)` | `Type (max ℓ_R ℓ_op ℓ_resp)` | inductive, predicative `max` (`12 §2`, `14 §1`; §2.1) |
| `Cap E` | `Type ℓ_op` | a value type |
| `State S` over `S : Type ℓ_S` | `ITree (State S) R : Type (max ℓ_R ℓ_S)` | `Op`,`Resp : Type ℓ_S` (§4.1) |
| pure `fn`/`const` (`ρ = ∅`) | `ITree 𝟘 R ≅ R : Type ℓ_R` | `𝟘.Op = Empty` collapses (§2.4) |

Every level is the **predicative `max`** of its parts: nothing drops a universe
(`12 §2`), nothing lifts implicitly (`12 §3`); the elaborator emits explicit
levels and the kernel re-checks them (`12 §4`). No effect construct is
impredicative or `Type : Type` — the row machinery adds **no new level rule**,
only instances of Π/Σ/inductive formation. *(This table is the level-discipline
reconcile pass the spec-author owes before the Architect handoff.)*

### 7.5 Conformance

`../../conformance/surface/effects/` — covering the five acceptance criteria
with **discriminating** cases (COORDINATION §7; every negative case must *flip*
on the bug it targets, not pass vacuously):

1. **Effect infer + escape** — a function calling two effectful helpers infers a
   2-effect row; `visits` with both **accepts**, `visits` dropping one
   **rejects**, naming the dropped effect (verdict flip; ≥2 distinct effects).
2. **Pure-kernel encoding** — an effectful program denotes to an `ITree` term
   the kernel checks; assert the structural `Vis` envelope and compare its
   payloads/`Ret` result under `42 §6.4`'s closure-free observation/probe
   boundary, not merely "elaborates" and never closure identity.
3. **Capability gate** — the same `perform` **rejects** with no `Cap E` in scope
   and **accepts** under a handler that provides it (denial-path flip).
4. **`space` + handler** — `run_state s₀` on an `inc`/`get` program resumes
   correctly; assert the **final state** value and that `inc`'s `old(n)`
   obligation discharges.
5. **`pure`/`impure` boundary** — a `foreign` with a non-empty row exposes its
   `Vis` op to a runtime handler; a `pure`-but-effectful `foreign` is rejected
   (`38 §3`).
6. **Direct `[State s]` surface** — drive the **real** producer, not a hand-fed
   harness (`conformance-hand-feeds-the-deliverable`): a `get`/`put` program run
   under `run_state s₀` through the **actual interpreter** returns the correct
   `(result, final-state)` Σ-pair (`R × S`, §4.2) — the post-increment `next`
   (`run_state 0 next = (0,1)`, `run_state 41 next = (41,42)`, §4.5.3). Assert the
   **paired value**, plus (a) **composition** — a `[State s, Console]` program
   threads state identically whether `run_state` or the Console handler is peeled
   first (commutation, §4.5.4); (b) **re-runnability** — the same tree under two
   `s₀` gives two independent results with no cross-run state (the C3-forbidden
   face, §4.5.5). `run_state` is a derived total definition, so kernel-untouched
   (AC1) holds structurally.
