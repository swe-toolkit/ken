## 1. Source text

- Source is **UTF-8**. Ken's notation operators may use the **curated** set of
  mathematical symbols in §1b (so `→`, `×`, `∧`, `Ω`, `≤`, `≠`, and `⊑`
  appear in source, matching the spec's notation). An ASCII spelling exists
  for every such symbol so no program *requires* a special keyboard (§1a).
  Stored identifier names are ASCII-only after the fixed §1b alias expansion
  (§1e, §2); Unicode remains available in those aliases, notation, literals,
  comments, and other specified payloads.
- Files use the extension `.ken`. Line endings are LF (CRLF tolerated).

## 1a. Notation: read-optimized canonical Unicode (`OQ-syntax` DECIDED)

Ken is **written by agents and read by humans**, so *writing* is cheap and
*reading* is dear — which **inverts** the usual ASCII-because-humans-type
tradeoff. Ken optimizes its **canonical form for reading**: the typability tax
that binds mainstream languages does not bind a language whose writers are
agents. Five principles (decided; the §2–§6 spellings are a starter under them):

1. **Match established CS/Math notation; never invent.** The legibility win
   comes from the reader's *existing training* — admit a glyph only if a
   type-theory/ CS-educated reader already knows it (`→ × ∀ ∃ λ Σ Π Ω ⊢ ⊑ ⊔ ⊓ ¬
   ∧ ∨ ∈ ≤ ≠ ≡ ℓ`). Decorative or novel glyphs are rejected — they *cost*
   legibility with no convention to amortize.
2. **A total ASCII transliteration.** Every notation token has a typeable ASCII
   form (§1b). A human may write either; the glyph carries **zero** extra
   information (round-trippable), so reading the ASCII loses nothing — the
   exploration/self-learning affordance.
3. **Formatter-canonicalized.** A **single mandated formatter** (gofmt-style)
   normalizes ASCII → canonical Unicode and fixes layout on save. Because humans
   read and agents write, **one canonical format** means the reader always sees
   consistent notation — no style variance to parse. (No formatting latitude.)
4. **Keywords stay ASCII words.** `const fn proc data record match space visits
   requires ensures prop proof theorem prove law` are *names* — legibility beats
   symbol density, and they are already typeable. Notation is reserved for
   *operators*, where a symbol carries established meaning; Unicode-ifying
   keywords would be decoration. (So the purity keywords `const`/`fn`/`proc`,
   `36 §1.6`, are ASCII words, not glyphs.)
5. **Curated and confusable-resistant (a security property, not only
   legibility).** The blessed **notation** set is bounded by the fixed §1b
   table, not by "any Unicode". The lexer recognizes only those listed glyph ↔
   ASCII pairs as aliases. The closed identifier-class subset expands
   `∀`/`∃`/`¬`/`ℓ` to the stored `ident` names
   `forall`/`exists`/`not`/`level`, and `Σ`/`Π`/`Ω` to the stored `conid`
   names `Sigma`/`Pi`/`Omega`. Each glyph and ASCII spelling is one token and
   therefore one binding, not two confusable identifiers. Outside that table,
   a non-ASCII alphabetic scalar at an identifier position receives the typed
   rejection. A reviewer therefore reads exactly the token distinctions the
   lexer enforces; there is no general Unicode-identifier normalization or
   repair.

## 1b. Starter notation table (iterates with the team)

Canonical glyph ↔ ASCII input, drawn from the notation the spec already uses.
**Starter, not final** — the team tunes spellings against real code; the
*principles* (§1a) are fixed. The ASCII fallback prefers an established TeX/CS
digraph where one is unambiguous, else the spelled-out name.

| Glyph | ASCII | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `→` | `->` | function type / arrow |
| `↦` | `|->` | match-arm separator |
| `λ` | `\` | anonymous function (named is `fn`/`proc`) |
| `∀` | `forall` | universal quantifier (propositions) |
| `∃` | `exists` | existential quantifier |
| `Σ` `Π` | `Sigma` `Pi` | dependent sum / product (binders) |
| `Ω` | `Omega` | strict-prop universe (`../10-kernel/12`) |
| `≡` | `===` | propositional equality (`Eq`, `../10-kernel/15`) † |
| `≤` `≥` `≠` | `<=` `>=` `/=` | comparison |
| `¬` `∧` `∨` | `not` `/\` `\/` | logical connectives |
| `∈` | `in` | membership |
| `⊑` `⊔` `⊓` | `<:` `\/` `/\` | IFC lattice flows-to / join / meet (`../60-security/61`) ‡ |
| `×` | `><` | product type |
| `ℓ` | `level` / `l` | universe level / label (role supplied by parser context) ‡ |

† Equality notation is the load-bearing fine choice: `≡` propositional vs. `==`
boolean `DecEq` (`33 §5`) must stay distinct (Lean/Agda convention); `=` is
**binding only**. The exact ASCII for `≡` (`===` vs. a named form) is a team
call. ‡ The lattice-op ASCII (`⊑`/`⊔`/`⊓`) remains a team call. The former
`ℓ` overload is resolved by §1d's semantic-name/source-lexeme distinction:
source `ℓ`, `l`, and `level` all produce semantic `Ident("level")`, while the
formatter losslessly re-emits whichever raw source lexeme was written. There
is no distinct level-or-label token kind.

**Known-stale conformance carrier.**
`conformance/surface/formatting/seed-canonical-format.md` FMT8
(`l-identifier-is-not-a-level-token`) still asserts the superseded,
unproducible level-token model. It remains unedited here and is tracked
separately as `CONF-FMT8-LEVELTOK`.

## 1c. BL3 — the canonical Unicode surface is lexer *and* formatter (SURF-1 D3)

> Status: **resolved** — a **direct consequence of §1a**, made explicit here for
> the BL3 build. The question "is the Unicode surface a lexer change or a
> formatting convention?" is answered **both**, exactly as §1a principles 2–4
> already decide; SURF-1 D3 does not add a new decision, only pins the division
> of labour and confirms **ASCII stays accepted**.

- **The lexer accepts both spellings as the *same token* (principle 2).** A
  curated Unicode glyph and its ASCII transliteration (`→`/`->`, `λ`/`\`, `∀`/
  `forall`, `Σ`/`Sigma`, `Ω`/`Omega`, `⊑`/`<:`, …, §1b) lex to the **identical**
  token — the §1b/§8 "the two are the same token" rule generalized across the
  notation table. So the glyph carries **zero** extra information and **ASCII
  spellings remain accepted forever** (no program ever *requires* a special
  keyboard). This is genuinely a **lexer** capability, not only a convention.
- **The formatter emits canonical Unicode on save (principle 3).** The single
  mandated formatter normalizes accepted ASCII input to canonical Unicode
  glyph (and fixes layout), so the reader always sees consistent notation. This
  is the **convention** half — but it is *downstream* of the lexer, applied to
  already-accepted source, never a parse gate.
- **Keywords are exempt — they stay ASCII words (principle 4).** The Unicode
  surface is for **operators/symbols** only; `const`/`fn`/`proc` and every other
  keyword (`31 §4`) stay ASCII words. BL3 Unicode-ifies the *operator* surface,
  not the keyword surface.
- **Confusable-resistance is enforced by bounded token domains (principle
  5).** The lexer accepts only §1b's fixed notation glyph ↔ ASCII pairs as the
  same token. The identifier-class aliases named in §1e/§2 expand to stored
  ASCII names before parsing a binding; for example, `ℓ` and `level` are the
  same `Ident("level")`, while `Ω` and `Omega` are the same
  `ConId("Omega")`. A non-ASCII alphabetic scalar outside the alias table
  receives a typed rejection at an identifier position. There is no general
  Unicode-identifier normalization or TR39 identifier profile in this
  contract.

**Build scope (BL3 / D4).** The build realizes the lexer's accept-both +
same-token behaviour and the formatter's Unicode normalization, then **runs the
formatter over the corpus** (prelude, `catalog/packages/*`, `examples/rosetta/*`) to
convert ASCII digraphs to canonical Unicode — landed together with the `view →
const`/`fn`/`proc` migration (D4) as one workspace-green unit. A Unicode-surface
`.ken` and its ASCII twin **elaborate identically** (acceptance 7), because they
lex to the same tokens.

## 1d. Canonical form and layout

The mandated formatter emits one deterministic canonical form. Its soft width
is **96 Unicode display columns**: a breakable syntactic group stays flat if it
fits and otherwise takes its prescribed broken form. Only an indivisible
identifier or literal, or a verbatim region, may exceed that width. This is a
deterministic fit decision, not formatting latitude. There is no configuration,
formatter-disable directive, or other escape hatch.

### Token-kind canonicalization and protected source

Canonical notation is chosen from the **parsed token kind**, never by replacing
raw source text. Accepted ASCII and Unicode aliases denote the same notation
token, and the formatter prints a dedicated notation token's blessed §1b
glyph. Identifier-class tokens have two distinct representations. Their
semantic stored ASCII name, after alias expansion, determines binding identity.
Separately, the formatter losslessly preserves and re-emits the original source
lexeme; it does not replace that lexeme with the semantic name. Thus source
`ℓ` remains `ℓ` after formatting while resolving to the same stored name and
binding as source `level`, which remains `level`. An identifier spelled `l`,
a keyword such as `in`, and an identifier or prose containing `not` likewise
retain their own source bytes. Outside the fixed alias table, the lexer rejects
a non-ASCII alphabetic scalar at an identifier position rather than repairing
it into a different binding.

The formatter preserves the source lexeme of every literal, including numeric
base, digit separators, suffixes, delimiters, and escapes. It does not rewrite
inside strings, raw or multiline strings, characters, bytes, comments, doc
comments, temporal-formula text, foreign symbol or library names, or any other
verbatim payload. Comment text is unchanged except for the physical-text rule
that removes trailing horizontal whitespace. Literal normalization is not part
of formatting.

Formatting is not refactoring. It must not reorder declarations, imports,
constraints, effect rows, constructors, fields, or instances; rename or
recase identifiers; regroup binders; switch declaration kinds or proof
spellings; desugar terms; add or remove types, arguments, constraints, or
annotations; or introduce helpers. It must not change `Equal` into Boolean
`==`, or conversely. Source order and every choice not designated canonical
below are preserved.

### Physical text and spacing

Canonical indentation is exactly two ASCII spaces per syntactic level; tabs are
forbidden. Output uses LF line endings, has no trailing whitespace, ends every
`.ken` file and every Ken fence body with one newline, and places one blank line
between top-level declarations. It inserts no blank lines between siblings in
one arm, field, constructor, or declaration block. Around an attached comment,
at most one intentionally separating blank line is preserved; otherwise the
formatter owns vertical whitespace.

There is one space on each side of infix operators, binding `=`, type `:`, the
match arrow, `as`, guard `if`, and row-tail `|`. There is no space just inside
parentheses, brackets, or record/refinement braces. A comma has one following
space and no preceding space. A semicolon has no preceding space and separates
sibling arms, fields, assignments, or local bindings; it is omitted after the
last sibling.
Projection `.`, qualified-path `.`, and attached-proof `::` have no surrounding
spaces. Sibling arrows, colons, equals signs, and bodies are **never** vertically
aligned; indentation alone expresses structure.

### Declarations, types, and applications

A declaration may remain flat only when its entire header and simple body fit.
A block body, including a compound `match`, lambda, `let`, or `if`, begins on
the following line. When a header breaks, the formatter:

1. keeps the declaration keyword, name, and attached subject on the first line;
2. puts each source binder group on its own line, indented one level;
3. puts the result type on a line beginning with `:`;
4. puts `visits`, each `requires`, each `ensures`, and a broken `where` clause
   on separate lines in grammar order;
5. keeps `=` at the end of the final signature or clause line; and
6. indents the body one level.

The formatter neither combines adjacent binder groups nor splits a grouped
binder. A short arrow chain remains flat. In a broken arrow or dependent-pair
chain, each domain occupies one line and each continuation line begins with the
arrow or pair constructor. Long `Equal`, `And`, and other type-constructor
applications break only at argument boundaries. Parentheses follow precedence
and the mandatory clarity cases: an arrow type used as an application argument,
an ascription used as a subexpression, and a lower-precedence infix operand
whose grouping would otherwise be unclear are parenthesized; the canonical form
carries exactly the precedence-required and mandatory-clarity parentheses
above; any other parenthesis is removed.

A flat application stays on one line if it fits. Otherwise its head remains on
the first line and each syntactic argument occupies one continuation line,
indented one level. Compound arguments nest relative to their enclosing syntax,
not a coincidental visual column. A projection or attached-proof selector stays
with its head when possible; arguments to the selected term break instead.

### Lambdas and branching expressions

The canonical lambda prefix is `λ`, followed by its binders and `.`; ASCII
lambda spellings are input-only aliases. Immediately nested lambdas may be
coalesced into one binder sequence only when the parsed term is identical and
no comment intervenes. A lambda remains flat when its body is simple and the
whole expression fits; otherwise its body begins on the next line, indented one
level.

A one-binding `let` remains horizontal when its complete expression fits and
its value and body are simple. With a compound value or body it has this
structure:

```ken ignore
let x : A =
  value
in
  body
```

A directly nested sequential chain of at least two local lets has one canonical
surface form: the formatter coalesces the maximal chain into a binding group.
It does not retain the repeated `in let` spelling. A short group remains
horizontal only when the complete expression fits:

```ken ignore
let x = first; y = second x in finish y
```

Semicolons occur between bindings, with no trailing semicolon before `in`. If
the complete group does not fit, or any binding, body, or attached comment
requires a break, the formatter emits this block form:

```ken ignore
let
  x : A = first;
  y : B = second x
in
  finish y
```

Every binding is indented one level from `let`. The closing `in` aligns with
`let`, and the body is indented one level from `in`; consequently the first
binding and final body have the same indentation. A compound RHS begins on the
line after its binding `=` and nests one further level relative to that
binding. A fitting type or application subgroup, including `List Char`, stays
intact rather than breaking one token per line.

Maximality is syntactic. Coalescing follows only a body whose expression node
is directly another sequential local `let`; it never crosses a lambda, match
arm, handler, or other expression boundary. The grouped and explicitly nested
inputs lower to the same ordered local-let chain, so coalescing introduces,
removes, reorders, duplicates, and renames no binding.

The duplicate-name rule (`32 §3`) also bounds coalescing. Starting from the
outermost binding, the formatter takes the longest consecutive segment whose
names are pairwise distinct. A nested binding that shadows a name already in
that segment begins a new nested segment rather than producing an invalid
group; a one-binding segment retains the ordinary one-binding spelling. Thus
legal nested shadowing remains legal after formatting.

Comments do not break the chain's maximality, but any comment within the chain
forces the block form. A leading comment stays immediately above its binding at
the binding indentation; an end-of-line comment remains attached to the
preceding binding under the general comment rule below; and interstitial or
trailing comments retain their parsed trivia owner. Neither coalescing nor
breaking moves a comment across a binding boundary or across the final `in`
boundary.

An `if` that does not fit, or that has a compound branch, has this structure:

```ken ignore
if condition then
  true_branch
else
  false_branch
```

The formatter never converts among `if`, `match`, lambda, and `let`, and never
eta-reduces or introduces or removes a binding.

The canonical empty eliminator is `match e {}`. A single-arm match may remain
flat only when its pattern and body are atomic, it has no guard or `eqn:`
modifier, and the whole expression fits. Every match with at least two arms is
multiline, with one arm per line. A compound or broken arm body begins on the
next line, indented one level past the arm. A nested match is always compound.
All but the last arm end in `;`, and match arrows are never aligned.

### Declaration blocks

A short sum containing only nullary constructors may remain flat. Otherwise a
sum is multiline with one constructor per line and a leading `|` on every
continuation constructor. An explicit dependent family always uses a multiline
`where { ... }` block with one constructor signature per line.
For a non-trivial sum, the first constructor begins on the line after `=`, at
one indent; every continuation constructor is led by `|`.

Every nonempty `record`, `class`, `instance`, `law`, `space`, `policy`, and
`module` block is multiline with one field, assignment, or declaration per
line. Empty blocks use `{}`. Field names and types are not aligned; a long field
type breaks by the type and application rules above. Constructor, field,
assignment, and declaration order is preserved. Canonical blocks use
**explicit braces**; the layout-vs.-braces language question in §6 may be
revisited only by a separate language decision and migration.

### Effects, contracts, refinements, and foreign declarations

Closed rows print as `[FS, Console]`, open rows as `[FS, Console | e]`, and the
empty row as `[]`; row order is preserved. A broken `visits` clause occupies its
own signature line. Every `requires` and `ensures` clause occupies its own line
and remains in source order; the formatter neither conjoins nor reorders them.
Refinements use `{x : A | φ}` spacing. `result` and `old` payloads are formatted
as ordinary parsed expressions.

A broken `foreign` declaration prints its Ken type and effect signature before
its `symbol`, `library`, and `pure` body. Foreign strings are verbatim. A
temporal or other specified verbatim body may be indented as a whole with its
containing construct, but its internal bytes are unchanged.

### Comments

Every comment is retained. A doc comment stays attached to the following
declaration. A leading comment remains immediately above the node it precedes,
at that node's indentation. An end-of-line comment remains inline only when the
code, two separating spaces, and comment fit within 96 columns; otherwise it is
placed immediately above the node it annotates. A comment between tokens forces
the surrounding group to break and is never moved across a syntactic boundary.

### Literate `.ken.md` source

The formatter recognizes exactly four fenced roles: `ken`, `ken ignore`,
`ken reject`, and `ken example`. A canonical opener is at column zero, uses
exactly three backticks followed immediately by `ken`, and, when present, one
ASCII space before the role word. A canonical closer is exactly three backticks
at column zero. Recognized fence bodies are formatted in place; adjacent fences
are not joined, declarations are not moved between fences, and roles are not
changed. Every byte of Markdown outside recognized fence bodies and their fence
markers remains identical.

Parseable bodies in all four roles receive the full canonical form. The only
layout exemption is an intentionally incomplete `ken ignore` body or an
intentionally syntax-erroring `ken reject` body that cannot be parsed. Such a
body receives token-kind-aware canonicalization only, over the tokens that can
be recognized without guessing structure; its layout and protected regions
remain unchanged. No other fence or source region is exempt.

### Preserved open spelling

Type application by juxtaposition and bracketed type application are the same
construct but remain under `OQ-syntax`. The formatter preserves the form that
was parsed and does not force one spelling until that decision is settled.

## 1e. Identifier character set (`SPEC-IDENT-BLESSED` DECIDED)

**Decision (2026-07-27): Shape C — ASCII names after alias expansion, with a
reserved extension point.** An accepted `ident` or `conid` has one of the
stored ASCII productions in §2. Source may spell the fixed, closed
identifier-class aliases from §1b as Unicode glyphs; the lexer expands each to
its named ASCII token before the parser admits a binding. Thus `ℓ`/`level` and
`Ω`/`Omega` are each one binding or name, not distinct confusable identifiers.
Every non-ASCII alphabetic scalar outside that table receives the typed
rejection. Source remains UTF-8 because aliases, notation, literals, comments,
and other specified payloads remain Unicode-capable.

Shape C is selected because it matches the landed lexer and every checked Ken
program, closes the identifier-homoglyph path through a total, single-valued
alias map plus an ASCII wall without inventing a character table, and records
the evidence a safe future widening would require. Shape A (the same
ASCII-after-expansion boundary with no reserved contract) is rejected because
it would leave a future widening's safety conditions implicit. Shape B (adopt
a Unicode identifier profile beyond the fixed aliases now) is rejected because
the corpus names no selected external profile or table, normalization rule, or
confusable policy, the landed lexer implements none, and no checked program
requires the widening.

A future widening beyond the fixed aliases is additive only through a separate
language decision that names its external identifier profile, fixes its
normalization and confusable-handling rules, and adds a conformance row with
both an admitted identifier and a rejected confusable control. This decision
does not select such a profile, alter §1b's aliases, or change the landed
lexer.

### Completeness inventory

The closure root for this decision is the active normative corpus
`spec/**/*.md` plus structured conformance rows. The identifier-level carriers
and their dispositions are:

1. This chapter's §1 source-text summary now separates Unicode source
   spellings from the stored ASCII identifier names produced after alias
   expansion.
2. Principle 5 in §1a and the BL3 rule in §1c now bind blessed notation to the
   fixed §1b table and bind stored identifiers to §1e/§2; neither names an
   undefined identifier set or an unimplemented TR39 identifier gate.
3. The canonicalization clause in §1d states both the closed alias expansion
   and the rejection outside it without changing any protected alias case.
4. The `ident` and `conid` entries in §2 state the complete stored ASCII
   productions and the complete identifier-class alias subset. Section 7's
   delivery summary refers to the same boundary.
5. Both former citations from §1a/§1c to `64-trust-model.md` are removed. That
   chapter contains no identifier-confusable contract, and none is needed:
   this is a lexical boundary, not a new TCB or trust-model claim.
6. `spec/90-open-decisions.md` preserves the operator's bounded,
   confusable-resistant principle and records its settled mechanism: §1b
   bounds aliases, while identifier names are ASCII after expansion and
   receive no general TR39 profile, normalization, or repair.

The examined complement is also closed:

- `docs/PRINCIPLES.md` §11 is a governance summary of the bounded
  notation/security property. It points back to §1a and defines no identifier
  production.
- `spec/20-verification/25-protocol.md` and
  `conformance/verify/protocol/false-unknown-non-confusable-roundtrip` use
  "non-confusable" for distinguishable serialized verdict messages, not source
  identifiers.
- `conformance/surface/declarations/unicode-twin-identical` covers general §1b
  notation glyph/ASCII twins, but does not supply the required same-binding
  identity control in a name position.
- The remaining §1b glyph producers are outside the identifier surface:
  `λ`, for example, produces the dedicated `Token::Lambda`, not an `ident` or
  `conid`. They neither admit names nor enlarge the identifier-class subset.
- Section 1b and §1d's `l`/`level`/`in`/`not` protections are the retained
  alias-versus-token-kind mechanism. They are described where they intersect
  identifiers and remain unchanged.
- `docs/program/**` task frames, issue records, progress/diary entries, and
  `crates/**` implementation/tests are historical or implementation evidence,
  not additional normative or conformance-row authorities. The landed lexer
  and its tests already enforce the selected ASCII-after-expansion boundary;
  this spec-only decision changes no behavior.

A black-box conformance row is nevertheless **owed and staged**, tracked by the
Steward without assigning a row identifier here. It must cover three cases:
ASCII `ident` and `conid` acceptance; typed rejection of non-alias non-ASCII
alphabetics such as Cyrillic `а`, `字`, and fullwidth `Ｔ`, including
confusable and non-confusable controls that distinguish the ASCII wall from a
TR39 gate; and acceptance of alphabetic alias glyphs `ℓ`/`Ω`/`Σ`/`Π` as their
ASCII names. The last case must prove identity: `ℓ` and `level` resolve to the
same binding, not merely that both spellings are accepted. This WP does not
edit a conformance path.

## 2. Tokens

```
token ::= ident | conid | keyword | literal | operator | punct | layout
```

Before applying these stored-name productions, the fixed identifier-class
subset of §1b expands `∀`/`∃`/`¬`/`ℓ` to
`forall`/`exists`/`not`/`level` and `Σ`/`Π`/`Ω` to
`Sigma`/`Pi`/`Omega`. No other Unicode scalar expands to an identifier-class
token.

- **`ident`** — value/term stored names: ASCII lowercase-or-underscore initial,
  `[a-z_][A-Za-z0-9_']*`. Primes (`x'`) are allowed (math-friendly).
- **`conid`** — constructor / type / module stored names: ASCII uppercase
  initial, `[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9_']*`. The case distinction (lowercase = term
  variable, uppercase = constructor/type) is used by `match` to tell binders
  from nullary constructors (`34`).
- **`keyword`** — reserved (§4).
- **`literal`** — numbers, strings, chars, bytes (§3).
- **`operator`** — symbolic, from a fixed set plus user-defined (`33`); fixity
  and precedence are declared (`infixl`/`infixr`/`infix N`).
- **`punct`** — `( ) [ ] { } , . ; : :: | = → @ ⟨ ⟩` and the spec brace
  `{ … | … }`.

## 3. Literals (the part that matters)

Literal *forms* are fixed even though syntax is otherwise OQ, because they
determine the numeric story (`35`):

| Literal | Examples | Default type |
|---|---|---|
| **integer** | `0`, `42`, `1_000`, `0xFF`, `0b1010`, `0o17` | `Int` (arbitrary precision) |
| **decimal** | `3.14d`, `0.1d`, `1_000.00d` | `Decimal` |
| **float** | `3.14`, `1e-9`, `0x1p-3` | `Float` (IEEE f64) — **only with a `.`/exponent** |
| **string** | `"…"` with escapes, `"""…"""` raw/multiline | `String` (UTF-8) |
| **char** | `'a'`, `'\n'`, `'\u{1F600}'` | `Char` (Unicode scalar) |
| **bytes** | `b"…"`, `0x[deadbeef]` | `Bytes` (`38`) |
| **bool** | `true`, `false` | `Bool` |

- **Critical rule (exact numerics at the lexer):** a bare integer literal is
  **`Int`**, never a float. `2` is `Int`; `2.0` is `Float`; `2.0d` is `Decimal`.
  Integers and floats are *different tokens with different default types*; there
  is no universal `f64` carrier at Ken's lexer. Numeric literals are
  **polymorphic** over the numeric classes via the elaborator (`35 §4`, `39`),
  defaulting as above when unconstrained.
- Underscores are digit separators and are ignored.

## 4. Keywords (proposal)

```
const fn proc let def data record module import export space capabilities
match if then else where requires ensures prop proof theorem prove law
visits foreign forall exists in as mut class instance
becomes declassify policy temporal assume test
```

Reserved but spelling-revisable (OQ-syntax), **except** the purity keywords
`const`/`fn`/`proc` (`36 §1.6`), whose spellings are **fixed** by the operator
ruling (SURF-1); `view` and the open-import form `use` are **retired**. `use`
remains reserved and produces a migration diagnostic rather than becoming a
free identifier. Reserving `export` is therefore a net increase of one keyword,
not reuse of a freed `use` slot. `let` remains reserved for the local
`let … in …` expression (`32 §3`). `type` is **reserved but not a declaration
keyword** — it named the definition/refinement construct before
`SURF-def-refinement` (`33 §1`) renamed it to `def`; `type` stays rejected as a
free identifier to preserve future optionality. Contextual keywords
(`infixl`, `derive`, …) are not globally reserved. The decided post-freeze
surface tokens are also lexed here (all spellings OQ-syntax):

- the contextual primary-expression phrase `structural result of x` (`32 §3`,
  `34 §3.1.1`). `structural`, `result`, and `of` remain ordinary identifier
  tokens outside that exact production. In particular, this does not change
  the existing `result` binder in an `ensures` clause. At a primary-expression
  boundary, the exact four-token sequence commits to the structural-result
  production; parentheses may disambiguate an ordinary application using the
  same identifier spellings. The formatter treats the whole phrase as one
  primary expression and preserves the spaces between its words;
- the wrapping-arithmetic operator `+%` (and `wrapping_add`, …) in the operator
  set (`35 §3`, OQ-1a);
- the type-level identifiers `Lazy` (OQ-eval-order) and `Wrapping` (OQ-1a,
  `Wrapping[T]`);
- an annotation token `annotation ::= "@" ident`, with `@ct` a named attribute
  (`../60-security/61 §5a`), distinct from any binary use of `@`.

## 5. Comments and documentation

- Line comment `-- …`; block comment `{- … -}` (nestable).
- Doc comment `--- …` (or `{-- … --}`) attaches to the following declaration and
  is consumed by the doc generator and the LSP. Doc comments may contain spec
  fragments and examples that the test framework can run (`../50-stdlib/`,
  strategy T3/T4).

## 6. Layout (indentation) vs. braces

- The DRAFT uses an **offside / layout rule** (significant indentation opens
  blocks: a `where`, a `match`, a `module` body), with explicit `{ ; }`
  available as an unambiguous fallback (the layout rule inserts virtual
  braces/semicolons).
- Whether Ken is layout-sensitive or brace-delimited is **OQ-syntax**; the
  grammar (`32`) is written against the brace form, and layout is sugar
  producing it.

## 7. What WS-L must deliver here

A lexer producing the token stream above with the fixed literal categories (§3 —
especially `Int`-default integers), the §1b Unicode + ASCII notation spellings,
the §1e ASCII-after-alias-expansion identifier boundary, comments/doc comments,
and the layout-to-braces translation. Conformance:
`../../conformance/surface/lexical/` — including the regression that `2 : Int`
and `2.0 : Float` are distinct (the f64 non-reproduction at the lexer).

## 8. V0 minimal lexer (the G1 slice)

V0 (the minimal elaborator, `../30-surface/39-elaboration.md §5`) lexes **only**
the token subset below — just enough to write a trivial dependently-typed
program. The full token set (§2–§4) is for the complete surface; V0 recognises
none of the rest (no literals, no operators, no layout, no annotations).

- **Keywords:** `fn`, `const`, `let`, `in`, `Type`. (V0 is pure-only, needing
  `fn`/`const` and never `proc`; `36`. `Type` lexes as a keyword in V0, not a
  `conid` — it is the universe former, `../10-kernel/12`. The landed V0 lexer
  still spells `view`/`let` until the D4 migration; the surface here is the
  target.)
- **Punctuation:** `(`, `)`, `:`, `=`, `.`, `;`, and the arrow `->` (canonical
  `→`; the two arrows are the same token, §1b).
- **Lambda:** ASCII `\` (canonical `λ`; same token, §1b).
- **Identifiers:** the §2 case distinction is load-bearing in V0 —
  **lowercase-initial** `ident` is a term variable; **uppercase-initial**
  `conid` is a base type (`Nat`, `Bool`) or other type constructor. Name
  resolution (`39 §5.3`) and type-position parsing (`39 §5.2`) rely on it.
- **Level digits:** bare non-negative integers (`0`, `1`, …) appear **only** as
  the optional explicit level after `Type` (`Type 0`); V0 has no other numeric
  literals (§3 is out of V0).

Whitespace separates tokens; line comments `-- …` (§5) are skipped. Everything
else in §2–§4 — block comments, doc comments, operators, the literal forms of
§3, layout (§6) — is **out of V0** and lexes only under the full lexer.
