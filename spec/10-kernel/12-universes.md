## 1. The hierarchy

Ken has a countable hierarchy of universes

```
Type 0  :  Type 1  :  Type 2  :  …
```

written `Type ℓ` for a **level** `ℓ`. Levels are the syntactic category from
`11-syntax.md §1`:

```
ℓ ::= 0 | suc ℓ | max ℓ₁ ℓ₂ | u        -- u a level variable (§4)
```

with the evident semilattice equations (`max`
associative/commutative/idempotent, `max ℓ 0 = ℓ`, `suc (max ℓ₁ ℓ₂) = max (suc
ℓ₁) (suc ℓ₂)`). Level equality is decidable and is part of conversion
(`17-conversion.md`).

**The defining rule — and the soundness anchor:**

```
  ────────────────────────  (U-Type)
  Γ ⊢ Type ℓ : Type (suc ℓ)
```

A universe lives in the *next* universe up. There is **no** `Type ℓ : Type ℓ`,
and in particular no `Type : Type`. Admitting `Type : Type` (which is what
unchecked universes amount to) makes the system inconsistent (Girard's paradox);
a conforming kernel MUST reject it. This is soundness
commitment §5.1 of `README.md` and is tested directly (G1, G5).

## 2. Predicativity

Universe levels of the connectives are **predicative**: a quantifier landing in
`Type ℓ` may only range over things in `Type ℓ` or below. The formation rules
for Π and Σ (`13-pi-sigma.md`) take the `max` of the domain and codomain levels:

```
  Γ ⊢ A : Type ℓ₁     Γ, x : A ⊢ B : Type ℓ₂
  ───────────────────────────────────────────  (Pi-Form)
  Γ ⊢ (x : A) → B : Type (max ℓ₁ ℓ₂)
```

so a function type does **not** drop to a lower universe than its parts. This
blocks the impredicative encodings that, combined with large elimination,
threaten consistency. An **impredicative** proposition universe (à la Coq's
`Prop`, where `(x : A) → P : Prop` regardless of `A`'s level) is **ruled out**
(`OQ-Prop`): it is incompatible with canonicity, and the impredicative-`Prop`
systems are not observational. Ken is **fully predicative**. Ω (§5) is a
*primitive strict, proof-irrelevant* proposition universe (`SProp`,
`16-observational.md §1`) — **predicative**, not impredicative — introduced by
the observational foundation (ADR 0005).

## 3. Cumulativity — non-cumulative (`OQ-2` DECIDED)

Ken is **non-cumulative** (`OQ-2` decided, operator 2026-06-27): `A : Type ℓ`
does *not* automatically give `A : Type (suc ℓ)`; lifting is explicit.
Non-cumulative is simpler to specify and check and keeps a **subtyping relation
out of the trusted kernel** — consistent with the small-kernel principle, with
following Lean's (non-cumulative) kernel (`17 §3`), and with the observational,
set-level foundation (ADR 0005; OTT-style systems are non-cumulative).

Cumulativity (a subtyping `Type ℓ ≤ Type ℓ'` for `ℓ ≤ ℓ'`, propagated
structurally through Π/Σ) is ergonomic — it removes a class of "universe too
low" errors — but adds a subtyping relation to the kernel and complicates
conversion *and* inference. Ken does not pay that kernel cost. Instead the
**elaborator** (`../30-surface/39-elaboration.md`, untrusted) supplies the
ergonomics: **universe polymorphism** (§4), **typical ambiguity** (write bare
`Type`, infer a consistent level), and **inserted lifts** where genuinely
needed. So the surface cost is low while the kernel stays small — Ken's
"cleverness outside, certainty inside." (Coq is the main cumulative system, with
a heavier kernel; Lean and the observational/OTT systems are non-cumulative.)

## 4. Level polymorphism

Definitions in the global environment MAY be **level-polymorphic**: a
declaration abstracts over level variables `u₁ … uₙ`, and each *use*
instantiates them.

```
Σ, (c : ∀ u₁ … uₙ. A := t)          -- a level-polymorphic definition
c {ℓ₁ … ℓₙ}                          -- a use, with explicit level arguments
```

**Admission closure.** Before admitting a declaration, the kernel checks
that its `level_params` are pairwise distinct and that **every** level
variable in its level-bearing terms is one of those parameters. This checks
nested `suc`/`max` levels in `Type` and `Ω`, explicit level arguments on
constants, inductive formers, constructors, and eliminators, and all nested
terms of a declaration's type and body. For an inductive it also checks the
family level, parameter and index telescopes, generated former type, and
each constructor's argument types, target indices, and generated type.
Postulates, primitives, and generated support inductives obey the same rule.
A recursive group's signatures are checked before staging; its bodies are
checked against their recorded level parameters before upgrading the staged
declarations. An undeclared level variable or a repeated parameter refuses
admission as `IllFormedDecl` rather than escaping into a later instantiation.
For example, `level_params = []` cannot admit
`f : Type (suc u) := Type u`, and `[u, u]` is refused even if `u` is
otherwise well-typed. Internal prelude entries are closed; the recursion
barrier inherits an already checked type rather than admitting new terms.

- Level abstraction is **only** at the level of top-level declarations, not a
  first-class `Π` over `𝕃evel`. Levels are not terms; you cannot pattern-match
  on a level or store one in a data structure. This keeps the term language and
  its metatheory unchanged by level polymorphism (it is "outside" the term
  calculus, like ML let-polymorphism).
- The kernel receives **explicit** level arguments on every polymorphic use. The
  elaborator infers them (typical ambiguity / level metavariables) and emits the
  explicit form; the kernel never guesses a level.
- Level constraints from a definition body (e.g. `max u₁ u₂ ≤ u₃`) are solved by
  the elaborator and **re-checked** by the kernel as ordinary level equalities
  at each instantiation.

## 5. The proposition classifier Ω (K2)

`Ω` is a **reserved grammar former** (`11-syntax.md §1`, tagged `[K2]`). It is
the strict, definitionally proof-irrelevant proposition universe (`SProp`) —
the subobject classifier where `Eq` and the logic live.

K1 reserves `Ω` in the grammar (it parses and is raw-well-formed) but
implements **none** of its typing rules, proof irrelevance, or conversion
behaviour. Those are defined in K2:

- **Typing of Ω, its inhabitants, and the Heyting structure** —
  `16-observational.md §1`.
- **Definitional proof irrelevance** (any two proofs of `P : Ω` are
  definitionally equal) — `16-observational.md §1`.
- **Interaction with `Eq` and `cast`** — `Eq A a b : Ω` (`15-identity.md`),
  `16-observational.md §2`.
- **Level-polymorphic Ω** — `16-observational.md §1`.

Until K2 is delivered, the kernel's `check`/`infer` treat `Ω` as an
unrecognised former (it fails typing).

## 6. What the kernel checks here

For the universe layer specifically, a conforming kernel MUST:

1. Implement decidable level equality and the semilattice laws (§1).
2. Enforce `Type ℓ : Type (suc ℓ)` and **reject** any derivation of `Type ℓ :
   Type ℓ` (§1).
3. Apply the predicative `max` rule at Π/Σ formation (§2, `13`).
4. Check explicit level arguments at every polymorphic instantiation and
   re-verify level constraints (§4).
5. Reserve **Ω** as a grammar former (raw-well-formed, `11-syntax.md §1`).
   Ω's typing rules, definitional proof irrelevance, and Heyting structure
   are K2 (`16-observational.md`). K1's `check`/`infer` reject Ω terms as
   unrecognised.

Conformance: `../../conformance/kernel/universes/` — K1 tests: the `Type:Type`
rejection, predicative-`max` formation, level-poly instantiation. Ω conformance
tests are K2-gated.
