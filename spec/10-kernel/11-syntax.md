The kernel operates on **core terms**: a small, fully-explicit language with no
implicit arguments, no notation, and no surface sugar. Elaboration
(`../30-surface/39-elaboration.md`) produces core terms; the kernel only ever
sees this language.

## 1. Syntactic categories

There are two mutually-referential categories:

- **Levels** `ℓ` — universe levels (`12-universes.md`).
- **Terms** `t, u, A, B` — the one category for both terms and types (types
  *are* terms of a universe; Ken is a pure type system in that sense).

```
ℓ ::= 0 | suc ℓ | max ℓ ℓ | lvar    -- universe levels (12)

t, u, A, B ::=
    Type ℓ                           -- universe (12)
  | Ω                                -- [K2] strict proposition universe (12, 16)
  | x                                -- variable (de Bruijn)
  | c                                -- global constant / definition
  | D | c_D                          -- inductive former / constructor (14)
  | (x : A) → B | λ (x : A). t | t u           -- functions Π (13)
  | (x : A) × B | (t , u) | t.1 | t.2          -- pairs Σ (13)
  | Eq A t u | refl t                  -- [K2] observational equality (15,16)
  | cast A B e t                       -- [K2] cast along Eq Type A B (16)
  | J M d e                            -- [K2] eq eliminator (derived) (15)
  | elim_D M [c_k ↦ t_k]ₖ s            -- inductive elim (14)
  | A / R / e | [t] | elim_/ M f r s   -- [K2] quotient: type / class / elim (16)
  | ‖ A ‖ | |t|                        -- [K2] propositional truncation (16)
  | let x := t : A in u
  | (t : A)                          -- ascription (erased after check)
```

Notes:

- **Type ascription** `(t : A)` is a checking hint only; it carries no runtime
  or conversion content and is erased once `t` checks against `A`.
- **Primitive types and literals** (`Int`, `Bytes`, …) are *not* primitive term
  formers here. They enter the kernel as ordinary global declarations — opaque
  constants plus reduction rules registered with the environment
  (`14-inductive.md §5`, `../40-runtime/41-values.md`). This keeps the core
  grammar closed and small.
- The grammar is **intrinsically typed in spirit but extrinsically presented**:
  the same syntax can be ill-typed; typing (`18`) is what admits a term.

**K2 reservations.** The formers tagged `[K2]` — `Ω`, `Eq`, `cast`, `J`, `A/R`,
`‖A‖`, and the quotient/truncation eliminators — are **reserved in the
grammar** for K1: they parse, and raw-well-formedness (§6) checks their scoping
(variable indices resolve, sub-terms are well-formed). But K1 implements
**none** of their typing, computation, or conversion rules. That work is K2
(`15-identity.md`, `16-observational.md`), and the full conversion for them is
K2c (`17-conversion.md`). Keeping them in the grammar from K1 means forward
compatibility — the core-term type does not change shape between K1 and K2.

## 2. Binding and de Bruijn representation

Surface and spec examples use **named** binders for readability (`λ (x : A).
t`). The kernel representation is **de Bruijn indices**: a bound variable is a
natural number counting binders outward from its occurrence (`0` = nearest
enclosing binder). This makes α-equivalence syntactic identity and substitution
capture-free.

- The context (§3) is a single telescope of **term variables** `x : A` only —
  there is no interval or cofibration namespace (those were cubical; ADR 0005).
  The binders `λ (x : A). t`, `(x : A) → B`, `(x : A) × B`, and `let` each
  introduce one term-variable entry; indices count them.

- The kernel MUST provide capture-avoiding **substitution** and **weakening**
  (§5). Implementations MAY use any internal representation (indices, levels,
  locally-nameless) provided the observable judgments are identical; de Bruijn
  indices are the reference.

- **Definitional unfolding** of a global constant `c` (δ-reduction) replaces `c`
  by the body recorded in the environment (§4). Constants are *not* de Bruijn
  variables; they are names resolved in the global environment.

## 3. Contexts

A **context** `Γ` is an ordered telescope of entries:

```
Γ ::= ·                       -- empty
    | Γ, x : A                -- term variable of type A
```

- Entries bind to the right: later entries' types may mention earlier variables.
- A term-variable entry `x : A` requires `Γ ⊢ A : Type ℓ` (or `A : Ω`) for some
  `ℓ` (well-formedness, `18`).
- There are **no interval or cofibration entries** — the context is term
  variables only (ADR 0005; observational equality needs no dimension context).

Context well-formedness `⊢ Γ ctx` and the judgments over Γ are in `18`.

## 4. The global environment

Type-checking is relative to a **global environment** `Σ` (distinct from the
local context Γ) recording top-level declarations in dependency order:

```
Σ ::= ·
    | Σ, c : A := t          -- transparent definition (δ-unfoldable)
    | Σ, c : A               -- opaque constant / postulate (no unfolding)
    | Σ, data D …            -- inductive family declaration (14-inductive.md)
    | Σ, c : A := prim p     -- primitive: opaque const + operation descriptor (41)
```

- A **transparent definition** `c : A := t` requires `· ⊢ t : A` in the
  environment so far. δ-reduction may unfold `c` to `t`. In K1, transparent
  definitions are **non-recursive** (they may reference only earlier
  definitions, per the acyclic environment rule below); recursive definitions
  must use the inductive eliminator (`14`). The full **termination check**
  (SCT-gated, `17-conversion.md §SCT`) that admits general recursive δ
  definitions is K2c.
- An **opaque constant** `c : A` (postulate) blocks δ; it is how axioms, FFI
  signatures (`../30-surface/38-ffi-io.md`), and abstract interfaces are
  represented. Postulating a closed term of `⊥` would break consistency, so
  introducing opaque constants of empty types is a soundness-relevant action the
  kernel records but does not itself forbid — policy is the elaborator's (`18
  §4`).
- Every opaque declaration has a required, non-optional human-readable audit
  label: abstractly, `Decl::Opaque { id, name, level_params, ty }`. There is no
  defaulted or unnamed opaque form. The label is metadata, distinct from the
  declaration's `GlobalId` and absent from core terms. It is **kernel-inert**:
  conversion, typing, admission, positivity, universe checking, and elimination
  MUST NOT inspect it or branch on it. These judgments depend only on the
  declaration identity, levels, type, and body or reduction data already shown
  above. Audit enumeration may expose the label; changing only the label cannot
  change any kernel judgment.
- **Inductive declarations** and **primitives** are detailed in `14` and `41`.
- The environment is **append-only and acyclic**: a declaration may reference
  only earlier ones. This is what makes δ-unfolding well-founded and is a
  precondition of the termination argument.

## 5. Substitution and weakening (reference operations)

The kernel MUST implement, and conversion/typing are defined in terms of:

- **Single substitution** `t[u/x]` — replace the variable bound by the nearest
  relevant binder with `u`, capture-avoiding. Used by β (`13`), ι (`14`), and
  the `Eq`/`cast` computations (`15`, `16`).
- **Weakening / context extension** — transport a term into a larger context.
- **Simultaneous substitution / explicit substitutions** MAY back the
  implementation for efficiency, but the observable result MUST equal the
  reference single substitution.

Substitution interacts with the environment only through variables; global
constants are invariant under substitution (they are closed in `Σ`).

## 6. Well-formedness vs typing

This chapter defines only **raw well-formedness** — that a term is built by the
grammar and that every variable index resolves to an in-scope term-variable
entry. It does **not** decide typing. A raw-well-formed term may still be
ill-typed (e.g. applying a non-function). The kernel's `check` and `infer`
(`18`) decide typing; raw well-formedness is their precondition and is what the
parser/elaborator must guarantee before calling the kernel.

In K1, the `[K2]`-tagged formers (Ω, `Eq`, `cast`, `J`, `A/R`, `‖A‖`) are
**raw-well-formed** under the same scoping rules as the rest of the grammar —
their sub-terms must be well-formed and their variable indices must resolve.
Their typing and computation rules are defined in K2 (`15`,`16`); until then,
`check`/`infer` treat them as unrecognised (they fail typing).

## 7. Notation used in the rest of `10-kernel/`

- `Γ ⊢ t : A` — `t` has type `A` in context Γ (and ambient `Σ`).
- `Γ ⊢ a ≡ b : A` — `a` and `b` are definitionally equal at `A` (`17`).
- `Γ ⊢ A` abbreviates `Γ ⊢ A : Type ℓ` for some `ℓ`.
- `t ⇓ v` — `t` evaluates to (whnf or full) normal form `v` (`17`).
- `t[u/x]` — substitution (§5).
- Inference rules are written with premises over a line and the conclusion
  below; side conditions are noted to the right.
