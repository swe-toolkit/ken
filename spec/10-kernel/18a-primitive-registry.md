The trusted-base ledger (`18 §5`) enumerates primitive declarations and their
operation symbols. In the landed system their `PrimReduction::Op` semantics run
in `ken-interp`, remain opaque to kernel conversion, and are therefore
tested-not-trusted value semantics rather than proof-producing reductions.
This registry makes that surface auditable: what is native, why it *earns*
native status, what class laws opacity forecloses, and the single external net
(the differential oracle) that checks it. Unless a paragraph explicitly says
K3, “reduces” in this chapter means **interpreter runtime evaluation**, never
kernel conversion.

## 1. Schema

One row per operation:

| column | content |
|---|---|
| **symbol** | the registered reduction symbol |
| **signature** | argument types → result type |
| **current-state** | `BUILT` (registered today) · `GAP` (spec-expected, not built) · `LEGACY` (dead-but-live / to remove) |
| **reduction-semantics** | what it computes, **+ the partiality face** (§2) for any op that is not total |
| **oracle-ref** | the **live** differential net (§3); `N/A` for non-native verdicts |
| **burden-of-proof** | the adversarial case: the in-Ken derived alternative + why native is necessary (underivable / a real perf cliff), or why it demotes |
| **provability-consequence** | which class laws (`Num`/`Ord`/`Integral`/…) become **postulate-only (audited-delta)** because the op is opaque, vs the derived counterfactual that proves them **zero-delta** — the trade |
| **verdict** | `NATIVE` · `DEMOTE→derived` · `RETIRE` (adjudicated by the Architect; oracle+burden by the conformance-validator; the two gates are a **conjunction** — neither alone admits a NATIVE op to the TCB) |

**The `current-state × verdict` pair is the TCB delta** Pat reads:

- `BUILT × NATIVE` — stays trusted (ratified, conditional on its AC).
- `BUILT × DEMOTE→derived` — **removed from the TCB** (a trusted op becomes
  checked-Ken stdlib; the class laws gain provability — **zero-delta** on an
  inductive carrier, **zero-NEW-delta** over an opaque floor like `Int` — but a
  **non-canonical** DEMOTE carrier can leave an `Equal`-tying class law
  **undeliverable**, e.g. `DecEq Decimal`, §5.6.1(4)).
- `GAP × NATIVE` — a **new trusted addition** (spec-mandated, currently
  missing).
- `LEGACY × RETIRE` — a latent-hazard reduction deleted.

## 2. The partiality discipline (`(C)` — a hard soundness AC)

A **partial** primitive — one whose result is undefined on part of its signature
domain (fixed-width overflow, `div`/`mod` by zero, a narrowing conversion, a
Unicode-invalid decode) — **must never reduce an out-of-domain input to a silent
value or to UB.** That is the same soundness shape as a silent wrap: *a wrong
value the kernel trusts.* The discipline is **face-independent** — a partial op
satisfies it in exactly **one** of three sound ways, and its row **names
which**:

1. **static** — the domain proof lives in the **signature**:
   `div : Int → (y : Int) → NonZero y → Int` (the `{ d | d ≠ 0 }` refinement,
   `34 §5`). An out-of-domain application is **rejected at elaboration** (no
   `NonZero 0` inhabitant).
2. **runtime** — a total-looking signature that **emits an obligation**:
   `div : Int → Int → Int` where `div x 0` yields an unsatisfiable `y ≠ 0`
   obligation (`22 §2.4`) that **degrades to panic / `Unknown`** at the
   unguarded site (`43 §2`), **never a value**. (This is the `35 §3.2`
   no-overflow discipline, generalized.)
3. **total-into-`Option`** — the **result type** carries the partiality:
   `Int.toInt32 : Int → Option Int32` (`None` out of range),
   `Float.toDecimal : Float → Option Decimal` (`None` on NaN/∞). The
   out-of-domain case is **representable and observably not-a-value**.

**Face selection (Architect-ruled).** The faces are not equal in soundness
posture. **(c) is the default-preferred** — the partiality lives in the return
type, with **zero reliance on a trusted backstop** (no obligation to discharge,
no degrade path the kernel must trust). Use **(b)** only when the domain
condition is *overwhelmingly static-dischargeable* **and** `Option`-threading
would be prohibitively viral — `div`/`mod` and fixed-width overflow qualify
(divisors and in-range values are usually statically known; an `Option` on every
arithmetic op is unusable). Use **(a)** rarely (when totality-in-the-type is
worth threading a proof at every call). A row lands on (b)/(a) only by **earning
an exception to the (c) default**, so the *trusted backstop* is the quantity
minimized. Reflect-don't-extend: (b) reuses the audited `22 §2.4` obligation
machinery already sealed for overflow rather than adding a parallel path.

A partial row using **none** of the three (a silent value / UB) is **blocked**.
The oracle for a partial row **must feed its domain boundary** (the zero
divisor, the overflow edge, the narrowing edge, the sign edge) — an oracle that
samples only the total interior cannot catch a silent out-of-domain result.

## 3. The differential oracle (the sole external net for a native op)

A native op is **trusted** — reduced in Rust, outside the term language. The one
external check is the **Rosetta differential**: the native reduction vs an
**independent reference**. `18 §5` clause (2) ("a correct partial function on
literals") is exactly what the oracle nets. Two properties are **jointly**
required for a NATIVE verdict (either alone is vacuous):

- **Independent reference (non-circular).** The reference path must compute by a
  route **independent of the op under audit** — a spec-defined algorithm
  (schoolbook bignum) or an independent implementation, **never the
  interpreter's own native reduction.** A "native vs interpreter" differential
  where the interpreter *is* the native path is **green-vs-green** against the
  very bug (the same wrong code on both sides). *Floor ops — `add_int`,
  `eq_int`, `leq_int` — have no lower Ken op to reference, so they ground here.*
- **Boundary operands.** The discriminating inputs must include the domain
  boundary (§2), not just the interior — otherwise a silent out-of-domain result
  is never exercised.

**A defining law beats a reference implementation (oracle selection).** Where an
op has a **defining algebraic law** — the div-mod identity
`a = (a div b)·b + (a mod b)`, a widening round-trip `narrow ∘ widen = id`, a
`neg` involution — **that law is the preferred oracle: it is non-circular by
construction.** A reference *implementation* can alias the native path
(green-vs-green — the same wrong code recomputed); a *law* is checked against
the op's **output algebra**, so it cannot alias the reduction it audits. Fall
back to independent-reference + boundary-operands only where **no defining law
pins the op** — e.g. `mul_int` has no cheap defining law, so it needs the
across-2¹²⁷ independent-bignum reference.

For a `DEMOTE→derived`/`DERIVED` op (checked Ken, **not** trusted) or a `RETIRE`
op (removed), oracle-ref is **`N/A`** — neither is a trusted reduction, so
neither needs the net.

## 4. Findings — the build diverges from the sealed spec (hard correctness-ACs)

The adversarial re-adjudication found the current build **non-reproducing five
sealed commitments** of `35` (`seed-numbers.md` is the net; these ACs restore
compliance).

**Trust-level (Steward-grounded, `@18aeee7`) — these are wrong values in the
tested-not-trusted `ken-interp` evaluator ring; the kernel's trusted checker is
intact.** `Eq` at a primitive type stays **neutral** (`ken-kernel/src/obs.rs`,
"no `primEq` reduction yet"), there is **no primitive `eq → Eq` reflection
lemma** in the elaborator (the only `declare_postulate`s are bytes-round-trip +
capabilities-auth), and **`ken-kernel` does not depend on `ken-interp`** — so a
wrong `eval.rs` value **cannot** inhabit a false kernel proof (no
`refl : Eq Decimal a b` for `a ≠ b`) and nothing transports. The precise,
generalizing defect is two-fold: **the evaluator computes wrong values, AND the
conformance net meant to backstop them is green-vs-green (§3, OF1/OF2) — the
tested-not-trusted posture is *incomplete* for these ops.** High-priority (they
are reachable on `main`), but **not a kernel-soundness emergency**. Severity by
evaluator-ring reachability (Steward-ordered):

**F1 ≈ F4 (live wrong values) > F2 (backstop-missing) > F3 (latent) > F5 (safe
gap).**

- **F1 — `Int` is i128-capped, not arbitrary-precision.**
  `EvalVal::BigInt(i128)` (`ken-interp/src/eval.rs:140`); `exact_int_binop`
  computes raw `op(i128, i128)` (`eval.rs:673-675`) before range-bucketing, so
  `mul_int` of two ~2⁶⁴ values overflows i128 → **debug panics / release
  silently wraps** — a wrong evaluator value (tested-not-trusted ring; kernel
  checker unaffected). Violates `35 §3.1` ("`+`/`-`/`*` total, no obligation",
  sound **only** if `Int` is genuinely unbounded). **AC: genuine
  arbitrary-precision reduction, no i128 ceiling.** (Adding an overflow
  obligation to `Int` instead is *not* spec-compliant — it contradicts §3.1 and
  defeats the unbounded type.)
- **F2 — bare fixed-width silently wraps (runtime face non-compliant).** The
  **static** face is present — `elab.rs:976-989` emits a `NoOvf a b : Ω₀`
  obligation per bare fixed-width op. But the **runtime** face violates
  `35 §3.2`: `eval.rs:682-697` reduce via `iN::wrapping_*` **unconditionally**,
  ignoring discharge, where §3.2 seals *undischarged ⇒ degrade, never wrap*. If
  the static gate is ever bypassed (open-term eval, a discharge-propagation bug,
  an eval-before-prove mode) the wrapping reducer makes a wrong evaluator value
  with no backstop. **AC: bare `add/sub/mul_intN` reduce via CHECKED arithmetic
  (overflow → panic/`Unknown`), NEVER `wrapping_*`; wrapping is reserved to the
  explicit `wrapping_*`/`+%` class alone.** (Under a discharged obligation the
  checked branch is unreachable — a pure backstop.)
- **F3 — legacy i64 `add`/`sub`/`mul`.** `eval.rs:744-746` wrap with no
  obligation and **zero registration** (dead-but-live arms). **AC: RETIRE —
  delete the three arms + a guard-test that `"add"/"sub"/"mul"` are unregistered
  and unreduced (stuck/`Unknown`),** so the hazard cannot silently return.
- **F4 — `Decimal` silently saturates.** `add_decimal` uses `saturating_add/mul`
  + a `.min(18)` shift cap (`eval.rs:606-635`) → a **wrong evaluator value** on
  large magnitude, violating `35 §2.3` exact base-10; **`decimal_eq` also
  saturates** (`eval.rs:624-635`), so two distinct decimals can compare `True`
  in the `ken-interp` surface `==`. This stays in the tested-not-trusted ring —
  `Eq Decimal` is kernel-**neutral** and `eq_decimal : … → Bool` has **no
  `eq → Eq` bridge**, so **no false kernel proof is inhabitable** (the earlier
  "false-proof / `refl`-inhabits" reading was over-classified; grounded above).
  **AC: all Decimal ops (incl. `eq_decimal`/`decimal_eq`) reduce EXACTLY —
  bignum coefficient, no `saturating_*`, no `.min(18)` — or emit an overflow
  obligation on a bounded rep; never silent-saturate.** *This AC is **subsumed**
  by the Decimal DEMOTE (§5.6): a derived `Decimal` has no trusted `eq_decimal`
  at all — equality becomes structural, kernel-re-checked — so the wrong-value
  path is **removed by construction**, not merely fixed.*
- **F5 — `leq_int` registered but unreduced (safe GAP).** `numbers.rs:233`
  registers it; `eval.rs:661-811` has **no comparison-order arm** → stuck on
  literals, `Ord Int` cannot compute. Stuck is *safe* (incomplete, not wrong).
  **AC: add the reduce arm, bignum-correct across the F1 boundary — delivered by
  the `Decimal`/`Char` demote tranche (§5.2.2) as a derived-def prerequisite,
  per the (A) ruling, not a later successor.**

**Structural closing net** (conformance, P1-precise): a whole-class
producer-grep of `prim_reduce`, not per-op sampling. Since
`checked`/`saturating` DEMOTE (§5.3, F-new), the sanctioned classes reduce to
one — **`wrapping_*` may appear only inside the explicit `+%` class, and
`saturating_*` may appear NOWHERE at all.** Any `wrapping_*` outside `+%` (a
bare op, the legacy path) or **any** `saturating_*` (the F4 `add_decimal` path)
is the violation; their absence elsewhere is the structural guarantee that no
bare/legacy/`Decimal` op silently wraps or saturates.

### 4.1 Cross-AC derivability (burden judged against the *fixed* language)

The adversarial burden (§1) is evaluated **"derivable *given the other ratified
ACs*", not "derivable on the build as-is".** A row can look native-necessary on
today's broken build yet be derivable once a sibling AC lands: `Decimal` is
native-necessary *only* because F1's `Int` is capped — F1's bignum fix un-gates
the `(coeff, exp)` derivation, so `Decimal` **DEMOTEs**. This imposes a
**dependency order**: a row whose derivability turns on another AC is
adjudicated *after*, or explicitly conditional on, that AC (the adversarial
default only bites if run to conclusion against the *post-fix* language).

**The F1 dependency root.** Three ratified ACs ride F1 (genuine bignum `Int`):
(i) F1 itself (`Int` totality); (ii) the `Decimal` DEMOTE (the derived `coeff`
is itself capped until `Int` is real bignum); (iii) `Float.toDecimal`
exact-for-finite (needs the derived-exact `Decimal`). F1-first is therefore a
**dependency fact, not a preference** — these cannot land before it (fixing the
Steward's post-ratification tranche order: **F1 → Decimal/`Char` demote → F2/F3
→ F5 → conversions**).

**Ordering-reduction placement (corrected).** The Bool-valued `Int` ordering
reduction (`leq_int`'s `prim_reduce` arm, §5.2.2) is a **prerequisite of the
Decimal/`Char` demote**, not a later successor: the derived `Decimal` exponent
alignment (§5.6.1) and the `Char` scalar-range check (§5.9.1) are inherently
ordering tests, so the arm lands **with** that tranche. Scheduling it later
rested on the premise that `Decimal` alignment needs only `mul`; the landed
`ea<eb` alignment branches disprove it. Pulling the arm up **resolves finding
F5** (§4, `leq_int` unreduced) within this tranche; the separate **conversions**
tranche (`checked_*`/`saturating_*`/`neg_int`, the `IntN↔Int` floor) is
unaffected — none of it the comparison arm needs.

## 5. The registry

Registrars: `ken-elaborator/src/{numbers,bytes,prelude}.rs` (assembled in
`ElabEnv::new`); reductions in `ken-interp/src/eval.rs::prim_reduce`. Kernel
admission: `declare_primitive` (`check.rs`), tag
`PrimReduction = OpaqueType | Op { symbol }` (`env.rs`).

### 5.1 Opaque primitive types

`Int`, `Int8/16/32/64`, `UInt8/16/32/64`, `Float`, `Float32`, `Bytes`, `String`
— opaque `Type 0` constants (`14 §5`), inhabited by literals + op results, in
`trusted_base()`. `Bool` is an **inductive** (`34`), *not* a primitive (its
GlobalId is reused, not re-declared). **`Decimal` and `Char` currently register
as primitive types but DEMOTE at the type level** (each a TCB removal):
`Decimal` → `(coeff : Int, exp : Int)` (§5.6), `Char` → the refinement
`{ c : Int | isScalar c }` (§5.9). `Map`/`Set` **retire to proved `data` trees**
over `Ord k` (`37 §3.3`, `../50-stdlib/52-map.md`) — derived, out of
`trusted_base()`, no primitive ops (§5.10).

### 5.2 `Int` arithmetic — floor + bignum cliff

| symbol | signature | current-state | reduction / partiality | oracle-ref | burden | provability | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `add_int` | `Int → Int → Int` | BUILT (F1-broken) | bignum add, **total** (AC: real bignum, no i128) | schoolbook-bignum ref, operands **across 2¹²⁷** (indep., not the interp path) | floor — opaque `Int`, no lower op; underivable | `Num Int` `+`-comm/assoc **postulate-only**; on inductive `Nat` **zero-delta** — trade: bignum speed ↔ provable `+` laws | **NATIVE** iff bignum |
| `sub_int` | `Int → Int → Int` | BUILT (F1-broken) | bignum sub, total | as `add_int` | floor | `Num Int` postulate-only; `Nat` zero-delta | **NATIVE** iff bignum |
| `mul_int` | `Int → Int → Int` | BUILT (F1-broken) | bignum mul, total | indep. bignum, across-2¹²⁷ (`2¹⁰⁰ × 2¹⁰⁰`) | repeated-`add` is **O(value) = exponential in bit-length** — a real cliff | `Num Int` mul-assoc/comm/distrib postulate-only; `Nat` zero-delta | **NATIVE** iff bignum |
| `neg_int` | `Int → Int` | GAP | `neg x ≡ sub_int 0 x` | N/A (derived) | **derivable, no cliff** — one-liner over `sub_int` (must type-check vs `35`) | — (derived → zero-delta) | **DEMOTE→derived** |
| `div_int` `mod_int` | `Int → Int → Int` | GAP | **face (b) runtime obligation** (a *justified* (c)-exception — divisors overwhelmingly static-nonzero, `Option`/divide viral; reuses the sealed `22 §2.4` overflow machinery): `div x 0` ⇒ unsatisfiable `NonZeroDivisor y` obligation ⇒ degrade-to-panic/`Unknown`, **never a value** (`div x 0 → 0` is the F1/F4 shape, blocked). **Negative-`mod` PINNED truncated** (`(-7) mod 3 ≡ -1`, machine `%`). `divExact : Int → {y//y≠0} → Int` derives on top | **the div-mod identity `a = (a div b)·b + (a mod b)` IS the oracle** (non-circular law); boundary = zero divisor + negative-dividend (trunc≠floor) | repeated-`sub` = O(quotient) = exp-in-bit-length cliff; opaque `Int` | `Integral Int` div-mod-identity postulate-only; `Nat` zero-delta | **NATIVE** face-(b) iff degrade-not-wrap |

> **`neg_intN` (fixed-width) does NOT demote** — `neg(MIN_intN)` overflows the
> asymmetric two's-complement range → **face (b) obligation class** (`NoOvfNeg`
> obligation), NATIVE. Only bignum `neg_int` (symmetric range, no overflow)
> demotes to the `sub_int 0 x` one-liner.

### 5.2.1 F1 delivery contract — the "iff bignum" half

The §5.2 verdicts read **NATIVE iff bignum**: `add_int` / `sub_int` / `mul_int`
/ `eq_int` / `leq_int` are trusted native reductions **only once** their
reduction is genuine arbitrary-precision — a fixed-width intermediate that wraps
or panics is the F1 wrong value, and a wrong value forecloses the eventual K3
promotion (a reduction that can produce a wrong value cannot be promoted to
kernel-executed). **F1's reducing scope is the built floor ops** — `add_int` /
`sub_int` / `mul_int` (arithmetic) and `eq_int` (comparison, reduced today).
**`leq_int` is out of F1's reducing scope**: F1 delivers only the
arbitrary-precision *representation* `leq_int` compares over — never its
reduction. Its `prim_reduce` arm is delivered by the **`Decimal`/`Char` demote
tranche** (§5.2.2), as a *prerequisite* of the derived `Decimal` exponent
alignment (§5.6.1) and the `Char` scalar-range check (§5.9.1) — **not** a later
successor tranche (finding F5's earlier scheduling rested on a premise the
landed `ea<eb` alignment branches disproved; §4.1, §5.2.2). WP F1
(`docs/program/wp/F1-bignum-int.md`) delivers the representation half; the §5.4
row records the arm. This subsection is the
**normative contract** the delivery satisfies; it fixes *what the reduction must
guarantee*, not the Rust that guarantees it (the interpreter line anchors are
perishable build detail, carried in the WP brief).

**(1) Totality — no fixed-width intermediate on the arithmetic path.** For
`add_int` / `sub_int` / `mul_int` the reduction computes the **exact**
mathematical integer for every operand pair, with **no** `i64` / `i128` (or any
fixed-width) value anywhere on the arithmetic path — not as an accumulator, not
as an intermediate, not as a fast-path result that later overflows. A
small-integer fast path is permitted **only** as a representation optimisation
that widens to the arbitrary-precision type *before* any operation that could
exceed its range, so it is never the path that wraps. **`eq_int` (in F1)**
compares over the **true** integers, never over truncated fixed-width images:
two distinct integers that share a fixed-width residue must **not** compare
equal.
**`leq_int` inherits this same arbitrary-precision representation; its reduce
arm is delivered by the `Decimal`/`Char` demote tranche (§5.2.2)** — F1
guarantees only that the comparison, once its arm lands, is over true integers
(never fixed-width residues), *not* that F1 reduces `leq_int` at all. This is
the `18 §5` clause-(2) "correct partial function on
literals" made total for the F1 floor ops (`add_int` / `sub_int` / `mul_int` /
`eq_int`).

**(2) The reduction interface is FROZEN.** The symbol-keyed primitive
registrations — the `add_int` / `sub_int` / `mul_int` / `eq_int` / `leq_int`
symbols, their arity, and their `PrimReduction::Op` entries in the elaborator's
number-primitive registry — are **unchanged** by F1. F1 replaces the
*representation and the arithmetic behind* the symbols, never the surface a term
elaborates against: a term that reduced through these symbols before F1 reduces
through the identical symbols after, and only the value it reaches changes (from
a wrapped/panicking one to the exact one). Renaming, re-arity-ing, or
re-registering any of them is out of scope and a break.

**(3) Store round-trip — a contract F1 ESTABLISHES, not merely preserves.** The
run-time store already carries the arbitrary-precision representation:
`Value::BigInt { sign, limbs }` — sign-magnitude, little-endian `limbs`, under
the `minimal_limbs` canonical invariant (no trailing zero limbs; a single zero
limb for `0`). The interpreter's evaluator value does **not** currently
populate it, so this is a bijection F1 **establishes**, not one it preserves.
F1 fixes the lossless conversion at the durable-value boundary in **both**
directions: every evaluator arbitrary-precision integer converts to
`Value::BigInt { sign, limbs }` and back **byte-identically**, the
`minimal_limbs` invariant is preserved by
construction (a freshly reduced value is canonicalised, never emitted with a
non-minimal limb vector), and durable canonical bytes stay stable regardless of
the arithmetic route that produced them. This is a **testable obligation**:
round-trip byte identity + minimal-limb canonicity + canonical-byte stability.

**(4) Crate-vetting — the ADR 0009 rubric-step-1 gate, made concrete.** F1 is
the first Phase-2 dogfood of ADR 0009's **curate-before-construct** rubric: the
arbitrary-precision arithmetic is **sourced from a battle-tested external crate,
not constructed in-tree** (in-tree / proved construction is the deferred K3 —
ADR 0009 tier-c — question, not this WP). The concrete vetting gate the curated
crate must clear — the `63` re-check discipline applied to a tool-chain build
dependency:

- **Pure safe Rust.** No `unsafe` on the arithmetic path — either the crate is
  `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, or every `unsafe` block is audited and the audit is
  recorded. (Default candidate `num-bigint`; fall back to a forbid-unsafe
  equivalent — `ibig` / `dashu` — if the default carries un-audited `unsafe`.)
- **Permissive, non-copyleft licence.** MIT / Apache-2.0 / BSD class —
  clean-room-compatible; **no** GPL / AGPL / CeCILL (a copyleft dependency is a
  clean-room violation, not merely a licence preference).
- **Actively maintained, widely adopted.** The "earned industry trust" that is
  the ADR 0009 selection criterion (rubric step 1) — a maintained,
  broadly-depended-on crate, not an abandoned or niche one.
- **Vendored + version-pinned + dependency-delta recorded.** The exact version
  is pinned, the crate (and its transitive additions) vendored, and the
  dependency delta documented per `63` + ADR 0009 — licence, `unsafe`-status,
  version, and transitive-crate additions all recorded, so this addition to the
  tool-chain's own trusted computing base is legible and re-checkable on update.

**(5) Trust level — tier-b tested-not-trusted, NOT a `trusted_base()` line.**
The curation move (rubric step 1) sources the crate, but the resulting trust
posture is **tier-b (tested-not-trusted)**, not tier-a: F1 adds **nothing** to
`trusted_base()` and touches **no** `ken-kernel` file. The whole `prim_reduce`
path is the interpreter's outer, tested-not-trusted ring — structurally gated
out of every proof-relevant position (the kernel keeps `Eq` at a primitive type
**neutral**; there is no `eq → Eq` reflection bridge and no evaluator dependency
in the kernel), so a curated-crate bug is a **wrong value, never a false
proof**. The single external net for these floor reductions is the **§3
differential oracle** against an *independent* arbitrary-precision reference —
never the production crate on both sides (that is green-vs-green against the
very bug). The **tier-c proved-native promotion** (K3, kernel-executed
reductions) is a **separate, later** WP that re-decides the *trusted*
representation behind this same frozen interface; F1 neither performs nor
presumes it.

**Guardrails (do-not-reopen, spec-level).** Interp-local; no `trusted_base()`
promotion (`declare_primitive` / `declare_postulate` untouched); no kernel file
changed (the neutral-`Eq`-at-primitive reduction stays neutral); the §2
partiality discipline and the numeric-tower surface (`§5.6`–`§5.9`) unchanged. A
kernel-touch is a **scope error → STOP and escalate**, not an F1 task. F1 is a
reduction-**value** change, so its no-regression gate is **workspace-green**
(the `18a` / K7 lesson): golden vectors and `.ken` artifacts riding the old
fixed-width behaviour migrate in the *same* green landing unit — never a
crate-only diff.

### 5.2.2 `Int` ordering (`leq_int`) — `Decimal`/`Char` prerequisite

The `Decimal`/`Char` demote (§5.6/§5.9) derives its arithmetic and its
refinement over F1's bignum `Int`, but two of those derived defs are inherently
**ordering** tests, not just `add`/`sub`/`mul`/`eq`: `Decimal` exponent
alignment (§5.6.1) picks the common exponent `min(ea, eb)`, and the `Char`
scalar-range check (§5.9.1) is a `≤`-bounded interval. So this tranche delivers
the `leq_int` `prim_reduce` arm as a **genuine prerequisite** of those defs —
resolving finding F5 (§4) here rather than as a later successor, where it was
scheduled on the premise (§4.1) that `Decimal` alignment needs only `mul` (the
landed `ea<eb` alignment branches disprove it). This subsection is the
**normative contract** that delivery satisfies; it fixes *what the reduction
must guarantee*, not the
Rust that guarantees it (the interpreter line anchors are perishable build
detail, carried in the WP brief).

**(1) Bignum-correct total order.** The reduction computes `a ≤ b` over the
**true** integers for every operand pair — never over fixed-width residues: two
integers whose fixed-width images misorder must still compare by true magnitude
(the boundary cases are mixed sign and operands beyond 2⁶³/2¹²⁷). It reduces to
a `Bool` **value**, total on all `Int × Int`, sharing F1's `Value::BigInt`
representation and the `eq_int` arm's arbitrary-precision discipline
(§5.2.1 (1),(3)).

**(2) Registration FROZEN; `<` DERIVED, not registered.** `leq_int` is
**already registered** (`Int → Int → Bool`, §5.4); this tranche adds **only**
its `prim_reduce` arm — no new symbol, no re-arity, no re-registration. Strict
ordering is **derived at the definition level** — `lt a b := not (leq_int b a)`
(pure `leq`, `¬(b ≤ a)`) — introducing **no** new registered primitive and
**no** new reduce arm (`<` reduces through the built `leq_int` + `not_bool`). A
direct `lt_int` primitive is a soundness-neutral ergonomics option, **out of
scope** here (keeps the primitive set flat).

**(3) Trust level — tier-b tested-not-trusted, zero `trusted_base()` delta.**
The arm is an interpreter `prim_reduce` reduction (`ken-interp/eval.rs`) —
**not** a kernel change and **not** a `declare_primitive`/`declare_postulate`:
it emits a `Bool` value and never touches definitional equality — the
kernel's
neutral-`Eq`-at-primitive and `conv.rs` stay **byte-untouched** (`git diff
--stat ken-kernel/` empty). Same outer, tested-not-trusted ring as `eq_int`,
structurally gated out of every proof-relevant position, so a bug is a **wrong
value, never a false proof**. Because `leq_int` is already registered, adding
the arm is **`trusted_base()`-neutral**.

**(4) Independent-oracle net (OF2, non-circular).** The single external net is
the §3 differential oracle: golden comparison vectors across the sign / 2⁶³ /
2¹²⁷ boundaries with mixed sign, or the order-defining law (`a ≤ b ⟺ ¬(b < a)`;
`a ≤ b ⟺ (a < b) ∨ (a = b)`) — **never** the production `num-bigint` crate's own
`Ord` on both sides (green-vs-green against the very bug). The exact
non-circularity discipline that nets `eq_int` (§5.2.1). This arm is what makes
`Ord Int` reduce (§5.4, previously postulate-only) and what the downstream
`Ord Char` (§5.9.1) and `Decimal` alignment (§5.6.1) reduce over.

### 5.3 Fixed-width arithmetic — the four op-classes (`35 §3.2`)

### 5.4 Comparison & boolean

| symbol | signature | current-state | reduction / partiality | oracle-ref | burden | provability | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `eq_int` | `Int → Int → Bool` | BUILT | bignum `=`, total (AC: bignum, not i128-truncated) | indep. bignum-compare, across-2¹²⁷ | opaque `Int` → no case-split → `DecEq` underivable | `DecEq Int` postulate-only; `Nat` zero-delta | **NATIVE** |
| `leq_int` | `Int → Int → Bool` | **BUILT** (reduce arm delivered by the `Decimal`/`Char` demote, §5.2.2 — derived-def prerequisite; registered `numbers.rs:233`) | bignum `≤`, total | boundary/sign-edge pair flips (indep. oracle, never `num-bigint` `Ord` both-sides) | opaque `Int` → `Ord` underivable | `Ord Int` postulate-only (audited-delta) | **NATIVE** |
| `not_bool` `and_bool` `or_bool` | `Bool[→Bool]→Bool` | BUILT | the `Bool` **eliminator** (`and a b = match a {True⇒b; False⇒False}`, short-circuit inherent — the non-scrutinee arm isn't forced) | N/A (derived) | **`Bool` inductive → the ops ARE the eliminator**; strict-prim vs `match` observationally identical (`Bool` pure), constant-factor, no cliff; a native op must not shadow the eliminator (subsume-don't-proliferate) | derived → zero-delta `Bool`-algebra laws | **DEMOTE→derived** (R1, ruled) |
| `eq_float` `eq_float32` | `FloatT → FloatT → Bool` | BUILT | IEEE `==`, total | IEEE `==` incl. NaN (`NaN ≠ NaN`), ±0 | opaque `Float` | **not a proof equality** (`35 §2.4`) — carries no `DecEq`/`Eq` law | **NATIVE** (honest IEEE, non-proof) |

### 5.5 `Float`/`Float32` arithmetic

| symbol | signature | current-state | reduction / partiality | oracle-ref | burden | provability | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `add/sub/mul/div_float` | `Float → Float → Float` | BUILT (`add/div` only registered; `sub/mul` skew) | IEEE-754, **total** (overflow → ±∞, NaN — honest, no obligation, `35 §3.3`) | rounding-sensitive operands vs IEEE r-t-n-e | opaque `Float`; IEEE is the machine contract | no algebraic laws (non-associative FP) — none provable either way | **NATIVE** |
| `*_float32` | `Float32³` | GAP (only `add_float32`/`eq_float32` built) | as `Float`, binary32 | as `Float` | — | — | **NATIVE** (register the missing) |

### 5.6 `Decimal` — DEMOTE→derived (post-F1)

`add/sub/mul/eq_decimal` are `BUILT` (native, F4-broken). **Burden unmet →
DEMOTE.** Once F1 delivers genuine bignum `Int`, exact base-10 `Decimal` is
`(coeff : Int, exp : Int)` with arithmetic **derived in-Ken**: `add` =
align-exponents (`coeff × 10^Δexp`, bignum `mul`) then bignum `add`; `mul` =
bignum-`mul` coeffs + `add` exps; `eq` = normalize + bignum compare. Every op is
**O(bignum-arithmetic) — the same cost as the native reduction** (which only
does coeff arithmetic); **no perf cliff** (unlike `mul_int`, there is no
derived- Decimal blow-up). So verdict **`BUILT × DEMOTE→derived`** — a **TCB
removal**, and the *better* soundness posture: (1) the derived ops are
**structural / zero-delta computational** (no trusted `*_decimal`). The
**`Num`/`DecEq Decimal` law-carrying instances are re-deferred, not delivered
here** — and, on the non-canonical `(coeff, exp)` carrier, are **not
structurally deliverable at all** (§5.6.1(4)): the value-equality `decimalEq` is
an `Eq`, not a `DecEq` for definitional `Equal`, so a `DecEq.sound` `Axiom`
would inhabit `Bottom`. The decide-once carrier call is `90 §OQ-decimal-eq`;
(2) the F4 **wrong-value** `eq_decimal` hazard **vanishes** — the derived,
checked value-equality, no trusted `eq_decimal` (§4 F4: a wrong `Bool` value in
the tested-not-trusted ring, never a false proof). Gated on F1's bignum `Int`;
oracle **N/A** (derived).

### 5.6.1 `Decimal` delivery contract — derived exact base-10 over F1 bignum

This subsection is the **normative contract** the §5.6 DEMOTE satisfies — what
the derived reduction must guarantee (representation-independent); the
interpreter line anchors are perishable build detail in the WP brief.

**(1) Removal-not-shadowing — the TCB shrink is REAL.** The native
`add_decimal`/`sub_decimal`/`mul_decimal`/`eq_decimal` `prim_reduce` arms and
their `reg_binop!`/`reg_cmpop!` registrations, plus the primitive `DecimalVal`
representation path, are **deleted**. `Decimal` becomes the derived pair
`(coeff : Int, exp : Int)` over F1's landed bignum `Int` — **no** surviving
primitive `Decimal` op or type, **no** new kernel flag / `Decl` variant. A
registration that survives *alongside* a derived def **grows** the surface —
that is the failure; the removal, not a shadow, is the mechanism (AC-G).

**(2) Exact arithmetic over bignum — F4 killed by construction.** Every op
computes over F1's exact `Int`: **no** `saturating_*`, **no** `.min(18)` clamp,
**no** i64/fixed-width coeff anywhere on the arithmetic path.

- `mul` = (`mul_int` coeffs, `add_int` exps) — **ordering-free**, reduces
  directly.
- `add`/`sub` = align to the common exponent `min(ea, eb)`; the shift magnitude
  `|ea − eb|` and the direction (which coeff scales) are decided by `leq_int`
  (§5.2.2), the scale is `coeff × 10^|Δ|` via `mul_int`, then
  `add_int`/`sub_int` the aligned coeffs.
- `eq` = align (via `leq_int` + `mul_int`) then `eq_int` the aligned coeffs —
  reduces to a `Bool` value on the bounded-align path, **never** a saturating
  false `True`.

The exact scale `10^|Δ|` is delivered by a **bounded** unroll (a general
`Int`-recursive `pow10` fails size-change termination over opaque `Int`; the
fixed unroll is SCT-clean). Beyond that depth the scale is a **stuck-marker** —
the internal `decimalPow10Unbounded : Int → Int` postulate (function-typed ⇒
soundness-inert; never reduces) — so a large-`|Δexp|` `add`/`sub`/`eq` goes
**stuck: exact-or-stuck, never clamped** (§4 F4 discipline — a missing value,
never a wrong one). The unbounded-`Δexp` completion is a **named forward
obligation**, tracked in the conformance seed's deferred set.

Discriminating closure (AC-D2): a coefficient product that overflowed i64 and
**saturated** under the old `mul_decimal`/`decimal_eq` (a false `True` on
distinct decimals — the F4 hole) now reduces to the exact value / correct
`False`. **Both** halves of F4 close this tranche — the `mul`-saturation *and*
the sharp `eq` false-`True` on distinct decimals — a **wrong `Bool` value** in
the tested-not-trusted ring, **not** a false proof (`Eq Decimal` is
kernel-neutral, no `eq → Eq` bridge; §4 F4) — now that `leq_int` reduces.

**(3) User-facing surface preserved; only the MECHANISM moves.** The `Decimal`
type, its `Num`/`DecEq` instances, and the `+`/`-`/`*`/`=` surface at `Decimal`
are unchanged for terms; only the reduction moves from trusted native primitive
to **derived-over-bignum**. A term reduces to the **same** value after — except
where the old value was F4-wrong, which now reduces to the correct value.

**(4) Value-equality op ships; `DecEq`/`Num Decimal` law instances re-deferred,
NOT structurally deliverable.** The `decimalEq` **op** is **value-equality via
exponent alignment** (align then `eq_int`), reduces to a `Bool`, and removes the
F4 **wrong-value** trusted `eq_decimal` from `trusted_base()` *by construction*
(§4 F4: the hazard was a wrong `Bool` value in the tested-not-trusted ring,
never a false kernel proof) — the computational win, unchanged. But **because**
it is value-equality on the **non-canonical** `(coeff, exp)` carrier (many pairs
per value — `(10, -1)` and `(1, 0)` both denote `1.0`), it is an **`Eq`**
(equivalence), **not** a **`DecEq`** (a decision procedure for definitional
`Equal`, `51 §2.2`): `DecEq.sound : IsTrue(decimalEq x y) → Equal Decimal x y`
is **not a theorem** — `decimalEq (MkDecimalPair 10 (-1)) (MkDecimalPair 1 0)`
reduces `True`, so a postulated `sound` `Axiom` yields `Equal Decimal`, and
`MkDecimalPair` injectivity gives `Equal Int 10 1 → Bottom` (a **false proof**,
not a wrong value). So `DecEq`/`Num Decimal` as specified are **not**
zero-NEW-delta structural proofs — they are **not deliverable at all** on this
carrier (the landedness of `DecEq Int`'s `Axiom` is irrelevant: `DecEq Decimal`
is not a transport of it — `Int` is canonical, `Decimal` is not). The honest
target is `Eq Decimal` (no `Equal`-tie), which itself bottoms on missing `Int`
arithmetic lemmas — so the lawful-`Decimal` deliverable is **re-deferred**
pending the decide-once carrier/quotient call (`90 §OQ-decimal-eq`); `Ord Char`/
`DecEq Char` are **unaffected** (canonical carrier: one value per codepoint).

The derived defs sit in the interpreter's
tested-not-trusted ring over F1's tier-b arithmetic (§5.2.1 (5)) and §5.2.2; the
demote touches **no** kernel file and **net-shrinks** `trusted_base()` — the
four `*_decimal` primitives + the `Decimal` type registration leave against
**one** honest-visible addition, the internal deferred-align postulate
`decimalPow10Unbounded : Int → Int` (§5.6.1(2)'s large-`|Δexp|` stuck-marker;
function-typed ⇒ soundness-inert). A **net shrink (−5** over the combined
`Decimal`/`Char` tranche**)**, **not** a zero-addition — the same
absolute-vs-net precision as the zero-NEW-delta `Char` laws (§5.9.1).

### 5.7 Conversions (`35 §5` — closed named set, no implicit coercion)

The conversion state is split. The complete fixed-width `IntN↔Int` floor is
**BUILT** for every width `N∈{8,16,32,64}×{signed,unsigned}`. Each public,
total widening `*_to_int : IntN → Int` is a native operation. Each unchecked
`int_to_*_raw : Int → IntN` cast is also native. The intended safe public
narrowing contract, `intToIntN : Int → Option IntN`, is an ordinary checked Ken
definition that range-checks with `leq_int` before calling the raw cast. The
landed elaborator nevertheless still inserts every raw spelling into the source
global environment: ordinary source can name it and apply it to an out-of-range
`Int`. That exposure is a named implementation gap, not a safe narrowing
contract. Thus the representation crossing stays native while the fallible
`Option` contract is derived. The literal-comparator realization uses only the
safe total widening direction. The other cross-representation conversions in
the table remain `GAP`.

This complete floor is what the derived `checked`/`saturating` families of §5.3
consume. It does not itself demote: opaque fixed-width values have no lower Ken
structure from which to derive the representation crossing. Deriving the public
range check adds no implicit coercion, but it does not hide the raw primitives;
their source visibility remains a gap until the elaborator stops exporting those
spellings.

| symbol | signature | face | current-state | oracle boundary | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `IntN.toInt` / `*_to_int` (all N, widening) | `IntN → Int` | total | **BUILT** — native exact widening | `Int.toIntN ∘ IntN.toInt = Some` on `T_MAX` (defining round-trip law) | **NATIVE** (floor) |
| `Int.toIntN` / `intToIntN` (all N, intended safe public narrowing) | `Int → Option IntN` | **Option** | **BUILT** — derived range check over native `int_to_*_raw`; raw spelling remains source-nameable (gap) | just-above-`MAX` ⇒ `None`, **never silent `Some`** | **DERIVED over NATIVE raw floor** |
| `Int.toFloat` | `Int → Float` | total, **documented-lossy** | GAP | rounding-sensitive value = **defined IEEE r-t-n-e**; opaque `Int`, direct contract | **NATIVE** |
| `Decimal.toFloat` | `Decimal → Float` | total, **documented-lossy** | GAP | **burden (re-run post-Decimal-DEMOTE):** naive `coeff.toFloat *. 10^exp` over derived `Decimal` **double-rounds** (two roundings compound → wrong last bit); **correctly-rounded decimal→binary is a real algorithm cliff** (David-Gay / Ryū-shaped, not a one-liner) → earns **NATIVE** | **NATIVE** (correct-rounding cliff) |
| `Float.toDecimal` | `Float → Option Decimal` | **Option** | GAP | `NaN`/`∞` ⇒ `None`; finite ⇒ `Some exact` | **NATIVE** |

Round-trip / conversion laws are postulate-only (opaque→opaque). **`toFloat`
ACs:** the rounding is **round-to-nearest-even** (IEEE default, pinned in the
reduction column) and the provability column **claims no exact round-trip**
(`toInt ∘ toFloat ≠ id`) — lossy-per-*defined*-semantics is correct under its
own semantics, unlike F1/F4 which are wrong under theirs. **`Float.toDecimal`
exact-for-finite** (every finite f64 is a terminating decimal) **depends on the
derived-exact `Decimal`**, so the chain **F1 bignum `Int` → derived-exact
`Decimal` → `Float.toDecimal` exact** rides F1 (a third cross-AC dependency,
§4.1). `Int + Int64` without an explicit conversion is a **type error**
(`35 §5`, no implicit coercion arm).

### 5.8 `String` and `Bytes` — NATIVE opaque buffers (`37 §2.4`, `38 §1.2`)

`String` (immutable UTF-8, NFC-normalized at construction)
and `Bytes` (immutable byte buffer) are **opaque primitive types**: their ops
act on the buffer with no case-split, and `String` earns native over a derived
`List Char` on real representation and traversal cliffs —
**NFC-at-construction**, compact UTF-8, and direct buffer operations
(`mul_int`-shaped, not convenience). So
`byteLength`/`charLength`/`++`/`slice`/`index`/`encode`/`decode` (String) and
`length`/`at`/`slice`/`concat`/`empty` (Bytes) are **NATIVE**, partiality
already face-(c)-compliant:

- index/slice/`at` out-of-range ⇒ **neutral** (no silent OOB read), `Option` at
  the surface (`38 §1.2`).
- `decode` invalid UTF-8 ⇒ **neutral** / `Result … DecodeError`; round-trip
  `decode ∘ encode ≡ Ok` provable (`38 §1.5`).

SUB-1 adds the bounded structural view required to reason about opaque byte
buffers:

| symbol | signature | runtime semantics | conversion posture |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bytes_to_list` | `Bytes → List UInt8` | construct `Nil`/`Cons` in byte order | `PrimReduction::Op`; opaque to kernel conversion |
| `list_to_bytes` | `List UInt8 → Bytes` | rebuild the identical packed buffer | `PrimReduction::Op`; opaque to kernel conversion |

The two operations are the complete new native surface. Their inverse
guarantees are the named postulates `bytes_list_roundtrip` and
`list_bytes_roundtrip`; those propositions are trusted declarations, not
additional primitive reductions. Thus the fixed `trusted_base()` delta is
exactly four entries: the pair plus the two propositions. Structural consumers
such as `bytes_nat_length = length UInt8 ∘ bytes_to_list` are ordinary checked
Ken and add zero further trust. No other byte combinator is native-ized.

**★ Pin: `String` equality is NFC-equality, not byte-equality** — the row must
state it (`"é"`-composed `≡` `"é"`-decomposed), the semantic-pin discipline of
truncated-`mod`. `DecEq String` is **postulate-only** (opaque buffer, like
`DecEq Int`) — but it **is** a real decidable equality because the runtime's
NFC-aware comparison decides the extensional relation, *unlike* the non-proof
`eq_float`; it can back `DecEq String`, with an audited delta. Its complexity
and in-process representation are private unless an implementation advertises
the optional `constant-time-equality` profile (`41 §4`). Non-definitional
`String`/`Bytes` laws
(`byteLength (s ++ t) ≡ …`) are prelude propositions (derived), adding nothing
to `trusted_base()`.

### 5.9 `Char` — DEMOTE→derived (refinement `{ c : Int | isScalar c }`)

**RULED refinement; TYPE + ops both demote (double TCB removal) — the fork was
forced.** An *opaque* `Char` has no projection to `Int` and no case-split, so
`eq_char`/`leq_char` could not derive (nothing to project) and would be NATIVE
by the *exact* argument that keeps `eq_int` native. The ops demote **iff**
`Char` is the refinement (which supplies the projection + the decidable intro) —
so {refinement-`Char` + demoted ops} (**zero-delta** computational ops,
**zero-NEW-delta** `DecEq`/`Ord Char` laws — no *new* postulate beyond `Int`'s)
is the coherent, strictly-better option over {opaque + native ops}
(Char-specific postulate-only, type stays in the TCB). Given bignum `Int` (F1):

- `eq_char`/`leq_char`/ordering ⇒ `eq_int`/`leq_int` on the free projection
  `proj : Char → Int` (CV-confirmed constant-factor) → **DEMOTE** — the **ops**
  reduce (zero-delta computational); the `DecEq`/`Ord Char` **law instances**
  are **zero-NEW-delta** over `Int` (re-home to the lawful-classes lane,
  §5.9.1(3)).
- `Char.toInt` = `proj` (derived); `Int.toChar : Int → Option Char` =
  refinement-intro with the decidable check → **face-(c)** (`None` on
  surrogate/out-of-range) → derived.

**Two load-bearing soundness pins** (the refinement is sound only with these):

1. **`isScalar : Int → Ω` via the Bool-decidable reflection** — pin the
   *encoding*, not just the sort: `isScalar c := IsTrue (inRangeBool c)`, with
   `inRangeBool c : Bool` =
   `(0 ≤? c && c ≤? 0xD7FF) || (0xE000 ≤? c && c ≤? 0x10FFFF)`.
   **`IsTrue b` is a genuine sub-singleton → proof-irrelevant → Ω.** A *naive*
   `(…) ∨ (…) : Ω` is the **forbidden direction**: a raw disjunction is the sum
   `A + B`, a two-constructor **proof-relevant** type that cannot sit at Ω
   directly (`16 §1.3`, the `Bool → Ω` trap). Range-disjointness does **not**
   rescue it — at most one summand is inhabited, but the *type* `A + B` still
   carries the injection tag, so it stays relevant. Ω-admissible only via the
   `IsTrue` form (pinned) or explicit truncation `‖A + B‖`. **Load-bearing:**
   pin 1's payoff — Ω-PI making `Char` equality reduce to **codepoint** equality
   (two `Char`s, same codepoint, distinct scalar proofs, equal by Ω-PI — a
   **zero-delta** kernel fact; the `DecEq Char` lawful instance itself is
   zero-NEW-delta) — holds only if `isScalar` is *actually*
   proof-irrelevant, which the naive-`∨` is not (and forcing an `A + B` into Ω
   would re-open the `Bool → Ω` inconsistency).
2. **String→`Char` extraction emits the canonical scalar proof** — `char_at` /
   `string_to_list_char` construct `(c, canonical_proof)`; sound because a
   valid-UTF-8 `String` only yields scalars, so `isScalar c` reduces to its
   canonical inhabitant. **No primitive can fabricate a non-scalar `Char`.**

`Char` literals (`'a' ↝ 97` + the scalar proof) are an elaborator concern.

### 5.9.1 `Char` delivery contract — refinement + derived ops (incl. `Ord Char`)

This subsection is the **normative contract** the §5.9 DEMOTE satisfies
(representation-independent); perishable anchors live in the WP brief.

**(1) Removal-not-shadowing — a double TCB removal.** The primitive `Char`
**type** registration (`reg_ty!("Char")`) is **deleted**; `Char` becomes the
refinement `{ c : Int | isScalar c }` over `Int`. `Char` has **no** native
computing ops on main today (no `eq_char`/`leq_char`/`Char.toInt`/`Int.toChar`
arm — `string_to_list_char` is a `Neutral` stub), so this is a type-conversion +
**net-new derived ops**, not the removal of working native ops. **No** surviving
primitive `Char` type; **no** new kernel flag / `Decl` variant (AC-G).

**(2) The refinement + `isScalar` Ω-encoding — soundness pin 1 (load-bearing).**
`isScalar c := IsTrue (inRangeBool c)`, with `inRangeBool c : Bool` computed by
**value-level** `Bool` `&&`/`||` over the decidable `Int` comparisons (`leq_int`
/ derived `<`, §5.2.2), then bridged to Ω by the **sub-singleton**
`IsTrue : Bool → Ω` (`IsTrue true ≡ Top`, `IsTrue false ≡ Bottom`). It is
**never** a naive `(…) ∨ (…) : Ω` — a raw disjunction is the proof-relevant sum
`A + B` (the `Bool → Ω` trap, `16 §1.3`); range-disjointness does **not** rescue
it (the injection tag stays). The build producer-greps that the definition is
`IsTrue(<computed Bool>)`, **not** a `∨`/`∃`/multi-constructor form at Ω.
**Payoff (load-bearing):** Ω-PI makes `Char` equality reduce to **codepoint**
equality (same codepoint, distinct scalar proofs → equal by Ω-PI — a
**zero-delta** kernel fact) — holds **only** because `isScalar` is genuinely
proof-irrelevant, which the naive `∨` is not. (The Ω-PI *collapse* is
zero-delta; the full `DecEq Char` **lawful instance** is **zero-NEW-delta**,
bottoming out at `DecEq Int`, and re-homes to the lawful-classes lane per (3).)

**(3) Derived ops over the projection — all reduce this tranche.** With
`proj : Char → Int` the free projection:

- `eq_char := eq_int` on the projections — the **op** reduces (built `eq_int`),
  zero-delta computational; the `DecEq Char` **lawful instance** is
  **zero-NEW-delta** (bottoms out at `DecEq Int`; re-homes to the lawful-classes
  lane, like `Ord Char`).
- `Char.toInt := proj` — reduces.
- `Int.toChar : Int → Option Char` = refinement-intro guarded by the decidable
  check (**face-(c)**): `isScalar c` reduces (via `leq_int`, §5.2.2) to
  `Top`/`Bottom`, so `Int.toChar` reduces to `Some ⟨c, proof⟩` on a scalar and
  `None` on a surrogate/out-of-range `Int`, **never** a silent `Some`.
  Discriminating (AC-C3): `Int.toChar 0xD800` (surrogate) and
  `Int.toChar 0x110000` (out-of-range) **reduce to `None`**; a valid scalar
  reduces to `Some` — and this **fails against a stub `isScalar := true`** (the
  obligation actually reduces, not name-matches).
- `Ord Char`: `leq_char a b := leq_int (proj a) (proj b)` — the **op** reduces
  (via `leq_int`, §5.2.2), computational and unaffected; its completeness rides
  `leq_int` reducing (lands this tranche → **no F5 dependency remains for
  `Char`**). The `Ord Char` **law-carrying instance** homes in the
  **lawful-classes lane** (next to `Ord Int`), **not** this demote: after
  refinement erasure `Char ≡ Int` (`21 §6.3`, `proj` the identity), so its `Ord`
  laws (reflexivity / antisymmetry / transitivity / totality) **are**
  `Ord Int`'s laws — established by **transporting** `Ord Int`'s visible
  audited-delta
  `Axiom`, **zero-NEW-delta** (no *new* postulate beyond `Int`'s; `§5.4`
  `Ord Int` postulate-only), **not** independently `Axiom`-free via `proj`
  injectivity. The honesty discriminator is a **declared-visible** law (the
  transported `Ord Int` `Axiom`) vs a **deceptive empty/false stub**, not
  zero-delta-vs-postulate.

**(4) String→`Char` extraction COMPUTES the canonical scalar proof — the runtime
face (soundness pin 2).** `char_at` / `string_to_list_char` construct
`(c, canonical_proof)` where the `isScalar c` witness is **reduced** from the
`String`'s UTF-8 validity invariant — a valid `String` yields only scalars, so
`inRangeBool c` reduces to `true` and the proof is the canonical inhabitant
`Proved : Top`. The witness is **computed**, never `declare_postulate` / `Axiom` /
`sorry` / hand-fed: an extraction path that *asserts* the scalar proof instead
of reducing it is the **trusted-not-proved hole** this pin exists to catch (the
static-vs-runtime-face discipline — grep the producer for obligation discharge,
not the type signature). **No primitive may fabricate a non-scalar `Char`.** The
refinement + derived ops sit in the tested-not-trusted ring over F1 + §5.2.2;
the demote removes the `Char` primitive type and adds **no** `trusted_base()`
line **of its own** and **no** kernel touch — a double net shrink (type +
would-be native ops). The one postulate the combined `Decimal`/`Char` tranche
adds is `Decimal`'s deferred-align `decimalPow10Unbounded` (§5.6.1), **not** a
`Char` line — so the tranche net is **−5**, a shrink, not a zero-addition.

### 5.10 Basic data structures — no primitive reductions

`List`/`Option`/`Result` are transparent inductive `data` (`34`) → **derived**,
consumed by `elim` — no primitive ops. **`Map`/`Set` join them** under OQ-A
(`../50-stdlib/52-map.md`): proved `data` trees over `Ord k`, consumed by
`elim`, **derived and out of `trusted_base()`** (the opaque `Map`/`Set`
primitive is retired, `../30-surface/30 §6`). `Array` **remains** an **abstract
type** (`33 §4`, `37 §3.2`) with **library-level** ops over the interface,
**not a `PrimReduction`**. The audit adds **nothing to the primitive-reduction
axis** here.

**Precision (so the TCB claim is exact):** "no primitive ops" ≠ "no trust." For
`Array` the operation-trust — whether `get`/`set` are `foreign` postulates in
`trusted_base()` or derived Ken over a representation — lives on the **FFI /
library axis (§6)**, adjudicated there. **`Map`/`Set` are now settled on that
axis: derived Ken with real proofs (`../50-stdlib/52-map.md §5`), not `foreign`
postulates.** "Confirms the TCB" here means *adds no primitive reduction*, not
*trust-free*.

## 6. Out of scope (noted, not re-adjudicated)

- **Effects** — `read_bytes`/`write_bytes`/`append`/`send`/`recv` are
  effect-tracked surface ops (`Vis` nodes, `36 §2`), **not** primitive
  reductions (they reduce to neutral, add nothing to the TCB). **X-series owns
  them.**
- **FFI** — a `foreign` decl is a `declare_postulate` (opaque, in
  `trusted_base()`), not a primitive reduction (`38 §2.3`); the postulate axis
  of `18 §5`, adjudicated there, not here.
- **Security, eval-order** — closed elsewhere.

## 7. Deliverable → Pat

The ratified native set, each op **conditional on its correctness-AC**, plus the
five findings framed **precisely**: **wrong runtime values in the
tested-not-trusted `ken-interp` ring with the conformance net incomplete
(green-vs-green) — the kernel checker is intact, no false proof transports**
(§4, 4-way source-verified). The five fixes are the **first, prioritized Phase-2
tranche** post-ratification, ordered by the F1 dependency root (§4.1): **F1 →
`Decimal`/`Char` demote → F2 + F3 → F5 → conversions**, each gated on the
independent-reference + boundary-operands oracle (§3). No drop-everything hotfix
(kernel intact); pulling F1+F3 into a pre-ratification correctness patch is the
Steward's call. The **TCB delta** Pat ratifies — the audit **net-shrinks** the
trusted base (the `Decimal`/`Char` demote is a **net −5**: six primitive/type
registrations leave against one honest-visible deferred-align postulate
`decimalPow10Unbounded` — a net shrink, **not** a zero-addition). **Leave**
(DEMOTE→derived — the trusted op removed and its class
laws gained: **zero-delta** on an inductive carrier like the `Bool` logic ops,
**zero-NEW-delta** over an opaque floor like `Int`/fixed-width for the rest —
except where a **non-canonical** carrier leaves an `Equal`-tying class law
undeliverable (`DecEq`/`Num Decimal`, §5.6.1(4)) — in
place of type-specific postulates): `Decimal` (type + ops), **`Char`** (type +
ops, a *double* removal), `neg_int`, the `Bool` logic ops, and
`checked`/`saturating`
(all fixed-width). **Enter** (GAP→NATIVE, spec-mandated): `div`/`mod` and the
**completed `IntN↔Int` conversion floor** (plus the `Int`/`Float`/`Decimal`
conversions). **Deleted** (RETIRE): the legacy wrapping path. Every surviving
native op is ratified **iff** it reduces correctly (bignum / checked-not-wrap /
exact / NFC / Ω-scalar-proof).
