Creates a PR for the target branch/commit and performs the publisher merge
gate.

Behavior:
  * doc-only: merge immediately.
  * non-doc: wait for the latest CI workflow duration + 10%, then poll PR
    checks until they complete; merge after all checks pass.

The script returns after the merge command succeeds.

# report_failing_job_logs <failing-checks-json>
#
# When publication stops on red CI, fetch the failing jobs' logs and print the
# subset that shows WHY. Without this the operator gets two job URLs and no cause,
# and agents hold no GitHub credentials to go look -- so the diagnosis stalls on a
# human. The publisher already has a token; this reuses it.
#
# ⛔ NEVER let this diagnostic change the outcome. Every failure path here is
#    non-fatal: the caller still dies on the original red-checks condition. A
#    broken log fetch must not convert a red PR into a crash with no verdict, and
#    must never be mistaken for a merge.
#
# ⛔ GREP THE FULL STREAM, THEN CAP THE RESULT -- never `tail` before the grep.
#    A probe truncated before its filter is not a measurement of what the filter
#    was looking for: the real error is usually thousands of lines above the tail.
#
# ⚠ CI LOGS ARE LARGE (tens of MB is normal), so every axis is bounded:
#     jobs        PUBLISHER_FAILLOG_MAX_JOBS=3
#     download    PUBLISHER_FAILLOG_MAX_BYTES=20971520  (20 MiB)
#     hit lines   PUBLISHER_FAILLOG_MAX_HITS=40
#     line width  PUBLISHER_FAILLOG_MAX_COLS=400
#   ⛔ EVERY BOUND ANNOUNCES ITSELF WHEN IT BITES. A silently truncated log reads
#      as a complete diagnosis, which is worse than no diagnosis -- the reader
#      concludes "that's the whole failure" from a window that could not hold it.
#      The byte cap is deliberately far above real logs so it practically never
#      fires; if it does, we say so and the grep result is explicitly a FLOOR.

# ── PART 2 (SRC-ATTEST): FRESH MERGE-RESULT AUTHORIZATION ────────────────────
#
# What this delivers, stated exactly — @architect ruling dec_50fdjy68gm01j.
# Read the boundary before trusting the guarantee.
#
#   1. UNCONDITIONAL. Old CI is never authorization. EVERY publish -- doc-only
#      and normal alike -- reconstructs the candidate on a freshly fetched
#      origin/main and runs origin/main's trusted checker immediately before
#      merge. This is what closes #885's stale-CI-authorization defect.
#
#   2. CONDITIONAL IDENTITY. "The tree we checked is the tree GitHub landed" is
#      true only within ADR-0003's exclusive-publisher model, and only because
#      all sanctioned merge attempts share ONE enforced critical section. That
#      is the lock below. Without it the claim has no support at all.
#
#   3. ⛔ RESIDUAL BOUNDARY -- NOT CLOSED, AND WE DO NOT CLAIM IT IS.
#      `gh pr merge --match-head-commit` pins the PR HEAD. GitHub exposes NO
#      base-SHA compare-and-swap. So an OUT-OF-BAND writer -- anything merging
#      outside this script -- can still move `main` inside the final API
#      round-trip, and the landed tree will not be the checked tree.
#      Step 4 narrows that window from the CI-poll duration (minutes) to one
#      round-trip. It does not eliminate it.
#      ⇒ "Closes #885's stale-CI authorization defect" is TRUE.
#        "Eliminates every final-round-trip race" is FALSE. Do not write it.
#
#   4. DETECTOR, NOT ROLLBACK. After the merge, compare the landed tree OID
#      against the synthetic checked tree OID and re-run the checker on what
#      actually landed. A mismatch or a red result is a loud publisher failure
#      that FREEZES further publication for diagnosis.
#      ⛔ NEVER auto-revert `main`. An automatic revert of a merge someone else
#        may already have built on is worse than the defect it responds to.
#
# ★ Why the dependency is enforced rather than documented: the previous version
#   of this gate was correct *because* the publisher happened to be serialized,
#   and nothing recorded that. That is the F13 finding, and it recurred one
#   layer up when the SRC-ATTEST frame asserted the identity claim outright. A
#   load-bearing precondition that lives only in prose is not a precondition --
#   it is a hope. So: acquire a real lock, or fail closed.

  #    operator saw an exit code and nothing else, on the one path whose entire
  #    job is to say something.
  #
  #    ⚠ And the probe missed it by `if`-wrapping the call, which puts the body
  #    in a condition context and SUPPRESSES `set -e` inside it -- so the probe
  #    exercised a different execution mode from production and reported the
  #    diagnosis firing when in production it could not. **A probe must call the
  #    function the way the caller does; the calling context is part of the
  #    behaviour under test.**

# Keep the PRIMARY checkout current with main.
#
# The publisher runs inside the LIEUTENANT's worktree and merges to the REMOTE
# main, so the primary checkout at /workspaces/ken -- the one humans and `moot`
# read -- drifts behind origin/main after every merge. This advances it, and is
# called only AFTER verify_landed_tree has confirmed the landed tree (so it
# never runs while main is in an alarm state).
#
# ⛔ NON-FATAL BY CONSTRUCTION. The merge has already happened and is verified
#    by the time this runs; a sync failure must NEVER fail an already-succeeded
#    publish. Every path returns 0. Mirrors report_failing_job_logs's discipline
#    (see the `|| true` at its two call sites).
#
# ⛔ ROBUST TO A LOCAL moot.toml OVERRIDE. moot.toml is the version-controlled
#    launch profile, but a live reseat can sit UNCOMMITTED in the primary's
#    working tree for a window. A fast-forward that would overwrite a dirty
#    tracked file is refused by git; we let it refuse and skip (logged), never
#    clobber. Once the reseat is committed and lands, the tree is clean and the
#    sync resumes on its own on the next merge.
#
# ⛔ ONLY EVER FAST-FORWARDS branch `main`. If the primary is detached, on some
#    other branch, or carries local commits on main (HEAD not an ancestor of
#    origin/main), it is left untouched -- advancing it could discard work.
