# Wrap Markdown to 80 columns

Your one job: reflow the prose in the given Markdown file(s) so **no line
exceeds 80 display columns**, **without changing any words, code, punctuation, or
meaning**. This is a pure whitespace/line-break transformation. You are a
formatter, not an editor.

## The width rule

- **Target 80** *display* columns = 80 Unicode codepoints, not bytes.
  Characters like `—` (em dash), `→`, `·`, `≈`, `Ω`, `‖`, `Σ`, and accented
  letters are **one column each** even though they are multiple UTF-8 bytes. Do
  not over-count them.
- **Tolerance: leave lines of 81–85 alone.** Only reflow a paragraph/list item
  that has a line **exceeding 85** columns — a few columns of overflow is not
  worth the tokens or the churn. When you *do* rewrap (because a line is >85),
  wrap the offending lines back to **≤80** (the target), not to 85.
- So: >85 → must rewrap to ≤80. 81–85 → acceptable slack, do nothing.

## What you may change

- **Only** the whitespace between words and the placement of line breaks within
  a paragraph or a list item's continuation lines.
- When you break a long line, wrap at a space boundary and continue on the next
  line. For a list item (`- `, `* `, `1. `, `> `), align continuation lines to
  the item's text indent (e.g. two spaces under a `- ` bullet; `> ` preserved on
  each wrapped line of a blockquote).
- You may pull a word up from the next line or push a word down to keep lines
  full and tidy, **as long as the word sequence is byte-for-byte identical when
  whitespace is normalized**.

## What you must NEVER change

- **Wording.** Never add, drop, reorder, rephrase, correct, or "improve" a
  single word. Never fix spelling or grammar. Never change capitalization.
- **Code and structure.** Never touch anything inside a fenced block —
  ` ```…``` ` of any kind, including ` ```mermaid `, ` ```ken `, ` ```text `,
  ` ```sh ` — nor indented (4-space) code, inline `` `code` `` spans, HTML
  comments `<!-- … -->`, or YAML front matter between `---` fences.
- **Tables.** Any line containing the Markdown table pipe structure (a row of
  `| … | … |` or a `|---|---|` separator) is left exactly as-is, even if >80.
- **Unbreakable tokens.** Never break inside a URL, a file path, an inline-code
  span, or a long hyphenated identifier. If a single unbreakable token (e.g. a
  long ` `code path` ` or URL) makes its line exceed 80 and it cannot move to a
  line of its own under 80, **leave that line as-is** and report it — do not
  force an ugly or meaning-changing break.
- **Blank lines, headings, list markers, emphasis markers** (`**`, `*`, `` ` ``):
  preserve them. Do not merge separate paragraphs. Do not re-level headings.

## Procedure

1. Read each target file.
2. Scan for lines **>85** codepoints that are **not** exempt (not in a fence, not
   a table row, not front matter). Lines of 81–85 are within tolerance — skip
   them.

   **Measure with Python, never `awk length`.** `mawk` — the default `awk`
   here — is not UTF-8 aware and counts *bytes* whatever the locale, so every
   `—`, `→` or `Ω` inflates the reading by 2. Compliant lines then read as
   violations and get churned, and the count you report back is wrong.
   Measured 2026-09-19: `printf 'a—b\n' | awk '{print length($0)}'` prints
   **5** for a 3-codepoint line. `wc -m` is correct but counts the newline.

   ```sh
   python3 -c 'import sys
   for i, l in enumerate(open(sys.argv[1]), 1):
       n = len(l.rstrip("\n"))
       if n > 85: print(i, n)' FILE.md
   ```
3. Reflow each offending paragraph/list-item minimally: rebalance line breaks so
   every line is ≤80 (the target), touching as few lines as possible.
4. Re-scan. Every non-exempt line must be ≤85, or explicitly reported as an
   unbreakable-token exception.

## Self-check before you finish (mandatory)

The transformation must be **whitespace-only**. Confirm it: conceptually, if all
runs of whitespace (spaces + newlines) in your output were collapsed to single
spaces, the result must be **identical** to the same collapse of the input.
(Front-matter, fenced, and table regions are unchanged, so they trivially pass.)
If you cannot guarantee that, you changed a word — revert and redo.

## Report

State, per file: how many lines you rewrapped, and list any lines left >80 with
the reason (table / unbreakable URL or path / front matter). Keep it to a few
lines. Your final message is a status report, not the file contents.
