A differential/parity test asserts *A agrees with B*. That is a **relative**
oracle. It is structurally incapable of detecting anything **A and B share** —
and the things two implementations of one contract most reliably share are the
contract's own ambiguities. So on any WP whose gate is a differential, the
parity result is near-worthless as evidence of correctness, and the highest-value
hunt is: **pick the axis both sides compute, read BOTH formulas, then check the
agreed value against the spec (an absolute oracle).**

Live case (2026-07-21, RT-PARITY @ `e892777c`): six executable interp↔native
differentials pinned checked buffer-IO narrowing. Parity genuinely held. But
both sides derived `TransferCount.remaining` from the **raw** request length
(interp `eval.rs`, native `cranelift_backend.rs`, from `positioned_bounds`
narrowed *before* dispatch and so blind to capacity), while the host **clamps**
to `effective = min(length, capacity - start)` (`effect_v1.rs`) and validates
the transfer against `effective`. Locked `spec/30-surface/38-ffi-io.md`
required the count be bounded by the *"effective request"*. Capacity-4 buffer,
`length: 8`, 4 bytes read ⇒ both reify `remaining = 4` on a **full** buffer;
spec required 0. All six differentials passed green.

**Root cause was partly the spec**, which is the recurring pattern: the
"effective request" clause and the read contract's own partition table
restated the bound inconsistently (`≤ requested` vs `≤ effective`). Both
implementations read the same table.

**How to apply:** (1) on a parity/differential WP, treat green parity as
*evidence about agreement only*; (2) enumerate the quantities both sides
compute and read each formula verbatim rather than trusting the differential;
(3) check the agreed value against the **normative** text, and when the two
disagree, grep the spec for its *own* inconsistent restatements of the same
bound — a shared implementation defect usually traces to a sentence, not to two
independent mistakes; (4) report parity-holds as a first-class negative so
nobody reads the finding as a parity regression. Sibling of
[[green-vs-green-does-not-confirm-a-fix]] (same blindness, one layer up) and of
[[differential-verify-which-mechanism-is-the-net]].

**Currency note (2026-07-28):** this defect has since been fixed on both
sides — the interp regression test
`budget_eff_capped_full_read_reifies_effective_not_raw_remaining` and the
native lowering path (now under
`crates/ken-runtime/src/cranelift_backend/lowering/core.rs` after
RT-NATIVE-FNSPLIT split the former monolithic `cranelift_backend.rs`) both
compute `remaining` from the reply's `effective_request`, and the spec's
partition table reads consistently. The bug is closed; the **method** —
audit the shared premise, not just the agreement — is the durable lesson and
still applies to any future differential gate.

## The shared serializer is the shared premise: probe every axis of it

**Measured 2026-08-16 on `de5ab0f04..c4df92d31`.** A differential's
serializer was named as its **single shared trust point**, with its field
order described as "exercised incidentally, not by design" and protected by
two properties of the corpus. Mutating it:

| axis | result |
|---|---|
| the two list fields swapped | **red**: that protection holds |
| the rule's two index fields swapped | **passes**: the named protection does not hold |
| bound-variable vs parameter constructor swapped | **passes**: nobody named this axis |

**When a component is named as the shared trust point, enumerate its axes
rather than checking the ones offered.** A stated protection is a hypothesis;
one of two was false and had been offered as measured, and the unmentioned
axis was the more interesting one.

**A uniform relabeling is invisible to a structural comparison.** The
constructor swap survives because it is a bijection applied uniformly, and
the comparison functions are purely structural, so every equality is
preserved and the mirrored side checks a different formula to the same
verdict. The only function that could catch it is the one that is not
structural (here a freshness check that looks specifically for the parameter
class); that it passed means the corpus never makes the distinction
load-bearing. So the pin is not "add a case" but "add the case where the
distinction is semantic": an eigenparameter number colliding with a live
bound index, so a relabel changes a verdict rather than renaming everything
consistently.

**Name the severity as control-validity when the artifact is fine.** The
checker under test was untouched and correct. A broken serializer weakens the
differential's own claim: "the two agree on these N cases" silently becomes a
statement about a different N cases. Say that, or the finding reads as an
attack on the code it defends.

**Count the recurrences out loud.** This was the fourth instance on one node
of a property holding because of what the corpus happens to contain, with
nothing making it hold. A tally makes a pattern arguable where four separate
notes read as four separate nits.
