# build/qa — cross-team QA lessons

Loaded by every QA role, in addition to `fleet`, `build`, and the team/role
scopes. Independent-verification discipline: green-vs-green traps,
discriminating-case construction, and the QA gate's own failure modes.

| Lesson | One-line |
|---|---|
| [bundled-changes-need-per-mechanism-isolation-flip](bundled-changes-need-per-mechanism-isolation-flip.md) | Bundled changes need a per-mechanism isolation-flip |
| [composition-wp-real-producer-may-be-deferred-engine](composition-wp-real-producer-may-be-deferred-engine.md) | Verify a composition WP's named producers are actually landed |
| [conformance-hand-feeds-the-deliverable](conformance-hand-feeds-the-deliverable.md) | A conformance test can hand-feed the very deliverable it should validate |
| [discriminating-flip-must-be-checked-per-test](discriminating-flip-must-be-checked-per-test.md) | An empirical discriminating flip must be checked test-by-test |
| [discriminator-negative-arm-must-be-expressible-and-reaching](discriminator-negative-arm-must-be-expressible-and-reaching.md) | A discriminator's negative arm can be vacuous if no upstream mechanism can express it |
| [eval-only-harness-cant-detect-phantom-arg-staleness](eval-only-harness-cant-detect-phantom-arg-staleness.md) | An eval-only harness can't detect phantom-arg staleness |
| [fold-in-doc-only-conditions-while-holding-branch](fold-in-doc-only-conditions-while-holding-branch.md) | Fold in reviewer-approved doc-only fixes directly while holding a branch |
| [isolate-executed-vs-present-before-naming-perf-cause](isolate-executed-vs-present-before-naming-perf-cause.md) | Isolate executed-vs-present before naming a perf cause |
| [isolate-mechanism-from-orthogonal-fail-closed-gates](isolate-mechanism-from-orthogonal-fail-closed-gates.md) | Isolate a mechanism from orthogonal fail-closed gates when probing a boundary |
| [structural-reachability-beats-empirical-probe-for-dead-code-fix](structural-reachability-beats-empirical-probe-for-dead-code-fix.md) | Structural reachability beats an empirical probe for a dead-code fix |
| [taint-axis-orientation-needs-distinguishing-pair](taint-axis-orientation-needs-distinguishing-pair.md) | Any classification discriminator needs a non-degenerate distinguishing pair |
| [two-arm-producer-needs-a-case-per-arm](two-arm-producer-needs-a-case-per-arm.md) | A multi-arm producer or gate needs a discriminating case per arm, including a fail-closed gate's deny/else arm; parity without a mechanism-off discriminator cannot show the new path fired. |
| [a-mutation-fixture-narrowed-to-the-bool-checker-surface-excising-a-kernel-checked-theorem-is-a-re-pin-not-a-weakening](a-mutation-fixture-narrowed-to-the-bool-checker-surface-excising-a-kernel-checked-theorem-is-a-re-pin-not-a-weakening.md) | Narrowing a mutation fixture to the Bool-checker prefix, excising a kernel-checked theorem, is a re-pin when the flip and meta-control survive and a structural pin compensates. |
| [verify-field-order-arity-against-declaration-not-prose](verify-field-order-arity-against-declaration-not-prose.md) | Verify field order/arity against the declaration, not prose |
