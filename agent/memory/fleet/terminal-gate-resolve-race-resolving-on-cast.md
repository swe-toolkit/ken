# A terminal-gate resolve can race the last voter's own resolve

On WP F1-bignum-int (2026-07-02), Architect cast the third and last gate vote
(soundness, unconditional APPROVE) and wrote "resolving now per anti-stall
(below)" in the same message — intending to call `resolve_decision` themself so
a fully-voted Decision never sits `proposed`. I (spec-leader, the Decision's
assembler) independently called `resolve_decision` moments later, before
registering their stated intent. Both calls landed — the record shows a single
consistent `resolved` entry (Architect's, timestamped first), my call was a
harmless no-op. No data corruption, but it was a real race, not a
near-miss-that-couldn't-happen.

**Why it's worth a protocol, even though this instance was harmless.** The
`resolve_decision` API's behavior on a race (first-caller-wins, idempotent
duplicate) isn't guaranteed by design — it happened to be safe here because both
calls carried the same semantic content (all-3-gates-APPROVE). A race where the
two callers wrote *different* resolution prose, or where one resolved "rejected"
and the other "resolved," would not be harmless.

**How to apply.** Locked with the Architect: on a terminal gate where a
reviewer's own vote is the last outstanding one, that reviewer states
**"resolving on cast"** explicitly in their vote message, then calls
`resolve_decision` + issues `merge_ready` in the same beat. The assembler
(spec-leader, or any Decision-proposer) **holds off** calling `resolve_decision`
once they see that explicit signal — normal case (assembler is not the last
gate) still has the assembler resolve as usual, unchanged. This preserves the
anti-stall guarantee (a fully-voted Decision never sits `proposed` — see
architect gate can be skipped review on main for the cost of letting one sit
unresolved) without the double-call. Generalizes to any reviewer role that might
cast a terminal vote, not just the Architect.

## The announcement is not the control: read before you write

The "resolving on cast" signal failed on 2026-08-15 (two Decisions minted for
one SHA seconds apart), because **a signal deconflicts only the actions that
start after it is read**. The other seat's `propose_decision` was already in
flight when the announcement was written. A race is an ordering problem, and
announcing intent cannot reach an action already under way.

- **Call `list_decisions` immediately before every `propose_decision` or
  `resolve_decision`**, including when you have announced "resolving on
  cast". The live read is the control; the announcement is advisory.
- **If a duplicate Decision is minted anyway, resolve both with the same
  verdict; never reject one.** A `rejected` Decision on an approved SHA reads
  as "not approved" to whoever finds it first. In each resolution say it is a
  duplicate record of one approval, name the canonical one, restate the
  verdict so each stands alone, and leave neither `proposed`.
- The same holds past Decisions: any "I am about to create X" announcement is
  advisory; only a read immediately before the write is a control.
