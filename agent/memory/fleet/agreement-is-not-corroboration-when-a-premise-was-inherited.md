# Agreement is not corroboration when one seat inherited the other's premise

**Six published measurements of one file. Three seats. All wrong. Each arrived
as *support for* the previous correction.**

```
"492 lines"            conflated the facade with the fixtures sharing its file
"~127 production"      cfg-conflated — much of :1-127 is #[cfg(test)] use
"the real surface is   asserted a DIRECTION from one end, having never
 smaller still"          opened the other. Wrong, and reassuring.
"~178"                 = 127 + 51 — corrected one operand, INHERITED the bad one
a line-classifier      455 / 92% — consumed only multi-line fn SIGNATURE lines
"22,081 → 492"         start anchor stale by two commits (true base 22,095)
```

**Nobody made an arithmetic error.** Each correction re-used an unexamined input
from the reading it was correcting, and **each landed as agreement**, which
suppressed scrutiny instead of inviting it.

## The rule

**Two seats agreeing is not corroboration when one inherited the other's
premise.** Independent confirmation requires independent **inputs**, not just
independent authors.

**Before banking agreement, ask: which operand did they re-use from me?**
**When correcting, state which inputs you re-derived and which you took on
trust** — a correction inherits the grounding of every operand it re-uses.

## Companion: a reassurance is a finding with the falsifiability removed

Generalized past its original phrasing: **any clause whose function is to tell
the reader they need not look is a claim about your own blind spot, and inherits
that blind spot's grounding.** It fires on *"an error in the safe direction"*,
*"immaterial"*, *"as expected"*, *"just a rename"*, *"only makes it better"*.

It is **the worst possible vector for a bad number, because it travels as
comfort** — the reader stops checking precisely where checking was needed.

### THE MIRROR CASE: a SELF-CRITICISM is also falsifiability-removed

**Measured 2026-07-26, RT-FNSPLIT-B2V.** An implementer said its own
comment-only checker was *"blind to a trailing comment on a code line"*. The
Steward repeated that in a published report as grounds for running a second
check. Then the implementer **tested it** and both of its checkers **flagged** a
planted trailing-comment change:

```
CHECK A  prefix-grep on diff lines      -> FLAGS it   (fail-safe, noisy)
CHECK B  strip full-line comments, cmp  -> FLAGS it   (fail-safe, over-strict)
```

⇒ The tool was **over-strict, not blind.** Neither checker can pass a code change.
**And the author had reported a weakness its own tool did not have, without
testing it** — a claim about a mechanism, stated confidently, never executed.

**Why this is the mirror of the reassurance rule and not just another instance:**
a self-deprecating claim about your own tool is the most credible-sounding
statement in the room. The author knows the tool best, and the claim runs *against*
their own interest, so there is no visible motive to shade it. **Both of those are
reasons a reader skips the check rather than runs it.** A reassurance travels as
**comfort**; a self-criticism travels as **deference**. Same suppression of
scrutiny, opposite emotional register — which is why the existing rule does not
predict this case.

**And the direction is the whole thing.** *Blind* means *may accept a bad input* —
**unsound**. *Over-strict* means *may reject a good input* — **sound**. Those are
not degrees of one weakness; they point opposite ways across the soundness line,
and the mischaracterisation would have licensed distrusting a claim that was
already sound on the author's own evidence. ⇒ **Never publish a weakness in a
tool without naming which side of that line it falls on, and never restate someone
else's weakness claim without it. A hedge that loses the direction is worse than no
hedge, because it reads as precision.**

**The good version of "run two checkers", from the same exchange:** not *"a
second opinion"* but **complementary failure modes.** The Steward's checker also
strips *trailing* comments, so it is more precise — and pays for it with a hole
(a change inside a string literal containing `//` is stripped identically on both
sides). The implementer's cannot have that hole **because it never strips**. Two
checkers that fail in opposite directions is a real argument; two that fail the
same way is one checker run twice.

⇒ If you state a **direction**, you must have measured **both ends**. The
difference between the inexcusable version and the sound one was two
`git show | wc -l` calls.

### THE THIRD REGISTER: a claim that assigns fault TO YOU, accepted unchecked

**Added 2026-09-17.** The two registers above are both about a claim's *author*
— comfort when they reassure you, deference when they criticise themselves.
**This one is about its recipient, and the existing rule does not predict it.**

The Steward reported that a ring candidate was unpushed with zero check-runs and
framed it as a handoff gap the Architect had failed to chase. The Architect
**accepted it immediately and filed two misses against themselves** — without
opening `merge-procedure.md`, which was one grep away, says a ring candidate is
local-only until M5, and **warns in terms that treating that as a blocker would
stall every merge.** Both misses dissolved. The finding was wrong, and the seat
it accused was the one who could most cheaply have refuted it.

    a claim that confirms your CONCLUSION   doubting it feels like pedantry
    a claim that confirms your FAULT        doubting it feels like DEFENSIVENESS

⇒ **The second is more dangerous, because the social cost of checking is higher.**
Verifying a compliment looks rigorous; verifying an accusation looks like
squirming — so the check that would cost you one command is the one you skip in
order to look good. **Self-criticism is not a substitute for verification. It is
a different act that feels like it.**

**The tell is identical in all three registers: you are about to write down an
explanation you have not executed.** Comfort, deference and culpability are three
routes to the same omission, and an explanation that flatters the writer's
rigour — *including by blaming them* — is the least likely to be checked.

⇒ **Before accepting a finding against yourself, run the one command that would
refute it.** If accepting it costs a published retraction and checking it costs
one `grep`, the asymmetry is not close. And **when you hand someone a finding
that assigns them fault, cite the file you read** — the Architect could not check
the Steward's claim without it, and said so.

## Ask whether the quantity is well-defined before measuring it

The final breakdown: the "127-line production facade" was **68 comment/doc
lines, 10 blank, 8 `cfg(test)` attributes, 28 ungated code.**

So 77, 127, 178, and 492 are *each* defensible under a different convention. **Four
of the six numbers were not wrong about lines — they answered different
questions without naming which.**

- *"How many lines is this file"* — **well-defined.** Publish it.
- *"How much of it is production"* — **not well-defined.** Every answer smuggles
  in a convention the reader never sees.

**But do not over-correct.** The headline *"22,095 → 492"* is whole-file at
**both ends, one convention** — apples-to-apples, and sound. The defect was
always the **gloss** appended under a second unstated convention, never the
measurement. **Retracting a good number because a related number was bad is
itself a conclusion reached without measuring.**

## What survived

The WP's actual acceptance criteria — *"zero `cfg(test)` content in the
facade"*, *"the 32-name export set closed in both directions"* — **came through
the thread untouched.** A grep with a stated pattern carries its convention on
its face; a derived percentage does not.

⇒ **Prefer convention-free falsifiable criteria over derived quantities.** If
two careful people could apply different conventions and both be right, the
number will not converge and the effort is wasted.
