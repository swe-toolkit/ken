# Deliverability is part of **mechanism selection**, not a post-review discovery

A design can be **fully correct and non-executable**. Those are two properties,
and only one of them is visible to the signals you run locally.

## What it cost

An implementer designed a visibility check needing a CI doctest lane, so the
candidate edited `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. The mechanism was verified
exhaustively: that doctests had no running home, that the step must be
shard-gated, that the aggregator would gate it. All correct.

The candidate was ruled undeliverable on the ground that **the publisher
credential lacks workflow-write**, so a branch touching that path is rejected
**at push, before a PR exists**.

## It is a DIFFERENT AXIS from the review-lane question

This is the part that fooled a careful leader, who ran a scope check and still
missed it — because the check they had answers a different question:

| the question | what it decides |
|---|---|
| *which reviewer lane does this diff need?* | Spec vote? Architect? doc-only §14a? |
| *can the authorized publisher actually PUSH these paths?* | whether the branch can exist at all |

The second is **not a refinement of the first**. `.github/workflows/**` is
"infra, not spec" — which correctly answers the lane question and says nothing
at all about deliverability. **Having an instrument for one gives no coverage of
the other**, and its greenness reads as reassurance.

## How to apply

1. **Ask it at mechanism selection, before building** — *"can the authorized
   publisher land every path this touches?"* It is cheapest before a candidate
   exists and most expensive after a review cycle.
2. **Flag it at kickoff for any WP that might touch outside `crates/` or
   `spec/`** — leaders and framers, put it in the scope check next to the
   reviewer-lane question, not inside it.
3. **Do not carry an enumerated boundary here. Measure at point of use.** This
   item used to read *"Known boundary (2026-07-22): the publisher credential
   cannot push `.github/workflows/**`."* **That was false for two months before
   anyone reading it noticed.** Measured 2026-09-17 against `origin/main`:

       commits touching .github/workflows/ by ken-ci[bot]   23
       of those, landed AFTER 2026-07-22                    18
       most recent                                          2026-09-04

   The operator granted the App the `Workflows` permission on 2026-07-21; see
   [[publisher-app-workflow-push-was-permitted-2026-07-21]], which records the
   supersession and the incident where two seats concluded a finished WP was
   undeliverable from the stale note — the Steward escalating to ask for a
   permission that had already been granted.

   ⇒ **Ask the repository, not this list:**

       git log --format='%an' origin/main -- <path> | sort | uniq -c

   Cf. [[an-enumeration-needs-a-proven-closure-not-a-better-grep]].

   > **Why the old item survived its own warning.** It said *"treat this list
   > as incomplete — the general move is to ask, not to memorize the
   > enumeration"* **and then memorized the enumeration, two sentences apart.**
   > A rule stated next to its own violation does not prevent it: readers
   > execute the concrete instance and skim the abstract caution. **An
   > enumerated instance inside a How-to-apply list is an imperative**, whatever
   > hedge sits beside it — so for mutable external state, carry the *query*,
   > never the *answer*.
4. **If a mechanism needs an undeliverable path, that is a mechanism fork, not
   a blocker** — pick a different mechanism, or escalate the credential. Do not
   build first and discover second.

## The generalization worth keeping

**Correct** and **deliverable** are separate properties and both are the
author's to establish. The same shape recurs wherever a constraint lives outside
the reach of every signal you can run:

- a **cross-crate** text oracle is invisible to every `-p <crate>` build
- a **credential** boundary is invisible to every local run
- a **CI-only** gate is invisible to a targeted local test

⇒ **Before trusting a green local signal, ask which constraints it is
structurally incapable of seeing.** That question has a short, real answer; the
signal's greenness does not contain it. Sibling of
[[a-tools-silence-is-scoped-to-the-question-it-asks]].

**It generalizes past code.** The Steward adopted this as a framing-time check
the same afternoon and it immediately caught a WP frame that pointed the next
ring at the very mechanism just rejected — the filing had been written while
that candidate was live and never re-derived against what merged. **The question
"can this actually be landed?" is as sharp against a brief as against a diff.**
