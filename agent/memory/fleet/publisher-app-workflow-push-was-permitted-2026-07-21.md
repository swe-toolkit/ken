# SUPERSEDED 2026-07-22 — THE PERMISSION WAS GRANTED. THIS TITLE IS NOW FALSE.

**The operator granted the `ken-ci` App the `Workflows` permission on
2026-07-21**, ahead of sharding the CI jobs. `.github/workflows/**` changes ARE
deliverable through the scripted publisher. Everything below describes a real
constraint that was real *when written* and is no longer true.

## How this note caused harm, which is the reusable part

On 2026-07-22 two seats independently concluded that a finished, QA-approved WP
(`CI-SKIPPED-NATIVE-TESTS`) was undeliverable — one from this note, one from the
matching stale line in `docs/ops/runbook-gh-identities.md`. The Steward escalated
to the operator and **asked them to grant a permission they had already granted.**

The disconfirming evidence was in the repository the whole time: three commits
under `.github/workflows/ci.yml` authored `ken-ci[bot]`. `verify-leader` FOUND
them, and did the right thing — held the documented claim and the contradicting
observation side by side and said *"I can't tell which; flagging that I don't
know rather than guessing."* The Steward did the wrong thing: explained the
observation away as "probably operator-pushed" and acted on the nine-day-old note.

⇒ **A recorded constraint about MUTABLE EXTERNAL STATE — credentials, scopes,
quotas, infra — is evidence about the past, not a fact about the present.** It
carries a timestamp whether or not one is written down. When an observation
contradicts such a record, **the record is what needs re-verifying, not the
observation that needs explaining away.**

⇒ **The generalization is not "keep notes fresh"** — you cannot notice that a
note went stale, because nothing changes when it does. It is: **for mutable
external state, TEST AT POINT OF USE.** A push either works or it doesn't, and
finding out costs one command. Never escalate a capability claim you have not
tried.

**2026-07-13 — kenfmt capstone C publish blocked.** C was Architect+QA
APPROVED (`91ea984d`) and honesty-gate-clean, but the scripted publisher
(`scripts/scripted-pr-automerge.sh`) failed at the **branch push** — not CI, not
review:

```
! [remote rejected] wp/kenfmt-c-capstone -> wp/kenfmt-c-capstone
  (refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow
   `.github/workflows/ci.yml` without `workflows` permission)
error: failed to push some refs
```

The publisher GitHub App's token **lacks the `workflows` permission**, so it
cannot create or update **any** file under `.github/workflows/`. The push is
rejected **before** the PR is created — so nothing lands, no PR, `origin/main`
untouched (clean failure, no partial state to unwind). This is independent of the
change's correctness; a one-line CI-step addition is enough to make the whole
branch unpushable via the publisher — which is the **only** GitHub-touching path
(agents' direct `gh` is not authed).

**The rule / preferred design:** enforce CI gates as **workspace tests**, not as
new workflow-file steps. A gate expressed as a `#[test]` that reads the target
files from disk and asserts the property (e.g. read each corpus file, assert
`format(file) == file` / `ken fmt --check` clean, naming any offender) is run by
the **existing** `cargo test --workspace --locked` CI step — so it enforces
day-one and everywhere cargo test runs, **and** the candidate touches no
`.github/workflows/`, so the publisher can push it. This is both more robust
(broader enforcement) and publishable. Frame CI-gate WPs this way from the start.

**How to apply:**
- **Framing:** when a WP's acceptance includes "wire a strict gate into CI,"
  specify it as a workspace test, NOT a `.github/workflows/*.yml` edit. Call this
  out in the frame's guardrails.
- **Honesty-gate:** before publishing, check whether the candidate touches
  `.github/workflows/` (`git diff --name-only <base> <cand> -- '.github/**'`). If
  it does, expect a push rejection — route a gate-relocation re-spin *before*
  attempting the publish, don't burn the failed push.
- **If a real workflow change is genuinely required** (rare), that is an
  **operator action** (grant the App `workflows` permission, or the operator
  lands the workflow file manually) — and it is **security-sensitive**
  (workflow-write = supply-chain surface), so escalate it as an operator decision
  rather than working around it.

Sibling to [[scripted-publisher-target-is-head-branch-never-main]] and the
publisher discipline in the steward skill (§ scripted publisher path). The
publisher is mechanical and permission-bounded; design merges to stay inside its
permission envelope.
