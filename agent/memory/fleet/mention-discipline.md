# Mention discipline

Two independent rules govern every `@mention` on the convo bus — **whether/why**
to mention, and **who** (the correct id). Both fail quietly, so both are habits,
not checks.

## Whether / why — mention IFF a question or a next action

Mention an agent **IFF** (a) you are asking them a question, or (b) you expect a
specific next move from them. **A mention is never an acknowledgment.** Silence
is acceptance — if your only reason to name someone is that you received / agree
with / are proceeding on their message, mention **no one** and post **nothing**.

- A status/checkpoint report mentions nobody.
- A reviewer's APPROVE needs no ack.
- "Packaging X / relaying to Y" is just **done** — mention Y iff Y moves next,
  never announced back to the requester.
- On a substantive routing post (decision, finding, handoff), mention **only the
  one actor whose move is next**, not the observers / requester / CC list.

Fast self-check before naming anyone: *"does this person have a move to make
because I posted?"* If no, drop the mention — often the whole post.

**Why:** a mention that expects no move is pure noise that trains the fleet to
tune mentions out, which then buries the ones that do need action.
Honesty-about- the-boundary, applied to attention.

## Who — grep the id, never type it

A `@mention` id (`agt_…`) must be **grepped from a fresh `orientation()` /
`list_participants` roster**, never typed from memory or pattern-matched to a
familiar-looking one.

**Why:** `post_response` / `reply_to` with a wrong `agt_…` in `mentions` **does
not error** — the message posts fine, it just notifies nobody. There is no error
surface (unlike a bad path or a failing test); the mistake is invisible until
someone notices the silence.

**How:** copy the target's `participant_id` immediately before composing the
mention, every time, even when you're sure. A recurring failure mode is typing
**your own id** by muscle memory (it feels familiar) — and you are never the
actor who acts on your own post, so your own id in a routing mention is always
wrong.

## The rule binds the enforcer too

This was re-tightened a second time in one day (2026-07-03) because the
ack-with-mention crosstalk regressed even after the first tightening — agents
kept posting "@X acknowledged" / "@X noted" / "@X standing by," each firing a
notification for zero required action. The Steward, who codified the rule, was
itself one of the offenders (confirmations that mentioned agents with no action
pending). **Codifying a discipline for others while violating it is the
failure** — self-apply first, in the same turn: when an incoming mention expects
no action of you (a peer's ack, a reviewer's APPROVE, a concurrence routed to
someone else), post nothing. That silence is the rule working.

## The `mentions` array is reliable — verify before concluding it failed

If a report claims a mention "didn't fire" (no notification reached the
recipient), don't bank that as a `mentions`-array reliability problem before
checking: the mechanism is the structured `mentions` array, and it works. The
likelier cause is that the event was read at `detail=standard`, which doesn't
surface the `mentions` array — so a correctly-mentioned recipient looks
unmentioned to whoever is diagnosing it. Re-check at `detail=full` before
concluding a mention silently failed; don't write down a causal claim about
tooling reliability on the strength of someone else's flag without independently
verifying it first (the same discipline as grounding-a-fabricated-citation).
Writing the literal `@name` in the message body is still good
belt-and-suspenders (it's the cue a human or a stale-status agent skimming the
thread uses to self-identify) — but keep doing it because it helps, not because
the `mentions` array is unreliable.

### The trigger is LATENCY, and latency and silence have opposite fixes

**The rule above recurred on 2026-08-14 and the Steward was again the offender**,
so the useful addition is not the rule but **what makes you reach for it.**

The Steward saw a review request sitting unanswered, read it at
`detail: "standard"`, saw no `@name` in the body, concluded *"it mentioned
nobody, so nothing woke the reviewer"*, and posted a backstop plus a tmux nudge.
The Architect measured it: `get_mentions(detail: "full")` returned that event
with `Mentions: @agt_37reqftfe6g00`, **and it is what woke them.** They were
already mid-review, reading the file in question, when the backstop arrived.

**The observable was never silence. It was a gap.** The request landed at 04:07
and the reviewer had been idle at a clean seam, so there was a delay before
their first post while they ground the SHA. In the Architect's words: *"a missed
mention is a routing defect to chase; a quiet reviewer mid-grounding is the
system working"* — **and they have opposite fixes**, so guessing between them
picks a repair for a problem you have not established.

⇒ **When a request looks unanswered, the question to ask first is "how long has
it been?", not "did it route?"** Reading at `detail: "standard"` makes *silence*
the only explanation visible, because it hides the `mentions` array while
showing you a body with no `@` in it. That is a property of your read, not of
the post. **One `detail: "full"` read settles it before any nudge.**

Cost when the guess is wrong: a redundant queued message, and a published claim
that a colleague's correct routing was defective. See

for the pane-read half of the same misdiagnosis.
