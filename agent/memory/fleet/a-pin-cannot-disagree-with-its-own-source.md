# A pin cannot disagree with its own source

**Four times in one work package, a green pin was checking a value against
another expression of the same value.** Not one was a careless test. Every one
was **exhaustive within its own notion of the surface**, and that is exactly why
none of them looked wrong.

| # | the pin | its two sides | why it could never redden |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | whole-graph differential, **tag** axis | emitted graph vs emitted graph | one of five `class_guard` sites reverted to a literal → **439 passed / 0 failed** |
| 2 | the same differential, **class** axis — **already CONFIRMED** by review | ditto | same one-site disconnect, same green |
| 3 | `..._closed_over_the_whole_product` | `boundary_class_mask` vs `boundary_relation_admits` | **both are expressions of one hand-written slice**; full product, green, structurally unable to notice that *nothing derived it* |
| 4 | a comment-only checker's own weakness claim | the author's belief vs the author's belief | never executed; it was **over-strict**, not blind — see [[agreement-is-not-corroboration-when-a-premise-was-inherited]] |

## The rule

**Before trusting a pin, ask what would have to be WRONG for it to redden —
and then ask whether that thing is the AUTHORITY or a restatement of it.** If
both operands trace back to the same source, the pin is a **consistency check on
a single value dressed as a correspondence between two.** It will be green in
every world, including the ones you wrote it to exclude.

**"Full product" and "exhaustive" are not defences.** Instance 3 covered the
entire finite product in both directions and was still vacuous, because
coverage measures *how much of the surface you compared*, never *whether the two
sides could differ*. ⇒ **Exhaustiveness is a property of the sweep; independence
is a property of the operands. Only the second one makes a pin evidence.**

## A CONFIRMED axis is where to look, not where to stop

Instance 2 is the one worth the entry. The class axis had been **confirmed by the
Architect**, and the implementer ran the winning mutation against it anyway. It
won there too.

**A code review is accurate about the code it reads and structurally cannot
report whether the pin behind it is as strong as both parties assume.** The
reviewer reads the *consumer* and sees it consult the authority; nothing in that
reading reveals that the *test* would pass with the consultation removed.

⇒ **A confirmation is not a reason to skip the mutation. It is the reason
nobody else will run it.** Both parties now believe the axis is closed, so the
one cheap command that would falsify it has no remaining owner. Corollary for
reviewers: when you confirm an axis, say **what you did not measure**, so the
confirmation does not silently discharge someone else's obligation.

## How to author against it

- **Derive one side.** A pin is evidence when one operand is *computed from* the
  authority and the other is *observed from* the consumer. Two hand-maintained
  tables agreeing tells you a human copied carefully once.
- **Perturb the AUTHORITY, not the test.** If your mutation edits the pin's
  expectation, you measured the pin. Edit the thing the pin claims to be
  downstream of, and require a red.
- **Per-site, not aggregate.** A differential over an aggregate is an
  **existential** — *someone* consumed the authority — not the universal it reads
  as. That is instances 1 and 2, and it has its own entry:
  [[a-differential-over-an-aggregate-is-an-existential-not-a-universal]].
- **Name the seed.** A fold's fail-closed default is only real if some
  perturbation reaches it; see
  [[withdraw-and-relocate-test-different-properties]].

Sibling of [[deriving-from-the-contract-cannot-detect-a-defective-contract]] —
that entry is about a *faithful derivation from a bad contract*; this one is
about a pin that cannot detect **any** contract, good or bad, because it never
had two independent operands. Also
[[never-pin-a-shape-that-cannot-state-its-own-contract]] and
[[an-enumeration-needs-a-proven-closure-not-a-better-grep]].

## Half a struct can be its own source

**Measured 2026-08-14 on `a998d3f6` (Adversary).** An AC's own wording flagged
the risk: *"each agreeing with an independent direct derivation. The agreement
is the claim; a shared derivation path would make it vacuous."* The relation is
a two-field struct, and the re-derivation built every candidate as

```rust
Occurrence {
    body_origin: child_origin(claimed.eliminator_origin, 1 + alternative)?,  // re-derived
    eliminator_origin: claimed.eliminator_origin,                            // COPIED
}
```

`body_origin` is a real derivation. `eliminator_origin` cannot disagree,
because it is copied from the claim into the candidate before the comparison.
The control's own printed output showed it: `carried={16, 5}
direct=Some({16, 5})` and `carried={12, 5} direct=Some({12, 5})`; the `5` is
identical on both sides of both rows because nothing re-derived it. Running the
control, not reading it, is what surfaced this.

- **When a control asserts "derived == carried" on a struct, check the
  derivation field by field.** A struct-level `assert_eq!` reads as one claim
  and is as many claims as it has fields. The copied field is usually the one
  the derivation needed as an input.
- **Compare the fields the mutation moves with the fields the assertion
  covers.** The mutation that measured the refusal perturbed `body_origin`
  only (the other field sat outside the `#[cfg(test)]` seed branch), so the
  measured refusal exercised the half that was already independent. A combined
  mutation makes a red an existential over its perturbations; a single-field
  mutation reported as validating a whole struct is the same attribution gap
  run backwards.
- **A validation is not a derivation, and its strength rests on a premise.**
  The copied field was not unprotected: the re-derivation returns `None` unless
  `forward_match_scrutinee(claimed.eliminator_origin) ==
  key.continuation_origin`. That is as strong as a derivation only under an
  unstated uniqueness premise (at most one parent has a given occurrence at
  position zero). State such a premise and list it as read-but-not-fired; it is
  what a later graph change breaks.
- **Report the per-axis count, not the row count.** The two governed rows
  shared `eliminator_origin` and `consumer_owner` and differed only in
  `body_origin`: two samples on one axis and one on every other. See
  [[a-population-held-at-a-degenerate-value-cannot-see-that-axis]].
- **Check a re-derivation at the site of the shortage.** The field was
  *carried* because the interning site cannot compute it; the re-derivation
  runs where it can, and uses the carried copy without noticing. A value
  carried because a later site cannot compute it will be re-checked at a site
  that can, from the carried copy.
