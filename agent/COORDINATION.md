# Ken coordination law (read by every agent)

Cross-cutting rules for every Ken agent, regardless of role, team, or model.
Role-specific discipline is in `playbooks/`; model tiers are in `MODELS.md`; the
git model is in `../docs/program/04-git-and-integration.md`. These rules are
adapted from hard-won mootup team lessons; each exists because skipping it
caused a real stall or a real bug. They must hold identically across Opus, GLM,
and DeepSeek agents.

## 0. The shape: a ring of rings

- **Within a team — a sequential token-ring.** Generally one agent is active at
  a time; the others are in a supporting role, called on when the active agent
  needs them (e.g. an implementer asks for a clarification). Keeping the whole
  team on one task maximizes coherence and effectiveness. Do not fan a team onto
  several tasks to chase parallelism — coherence beats it. This includes waiting
  on CI: once a WP is published, the team **waits idle** for its CI run rather
  than pipelining or stacking work (ADR 0002). Idle is cheap and load-friendly;
  throughput comes from other teams' rings, not from this one multitasking.
- **Across teams — parallel.** The teams are independent rings spinning at once;
  that parallelism is the entire reason the work is articulated into teams. The
  rings couple at only three points: merges to `main` (via the publisher path),
  the roadmap gate dependencies, and the **sanctioned cross-team query edges**
  (§9, §11). Keep that coupling thin — it is what serializes the federation if
  abused.

## 1. Event-driven, never poll

After you finish a unit of work or hand off, **post, set status, and stop.** Do
not `/loop`, self-wake, or poll for replies. The notification system delivers
what you need; polling burns tokens for zero value. A missing notification is a
*stall* — catching stalls is the team leader's watchdog job, not yours. Only
team leaders and the Steward run schedulers.

### 1a. "Event-driven" REQUIRES A NAMED EVENT. A hold you cannot name is a stall.

**Measured, 2026-07-22 — a three-way circular wait that no participant could
see, and that no watchdog would ever have broken:**

| seat | believed it was waiting for | actually |
|---|---|---|
| `verify-leader` | the implementer to pick up a new kickoff | idle |
| `verify-implementer` | *the leader's merge Decision* on work already finished | idle |
| `verify-qa` | nothing — verdict delivered, handed back | idle |

Every seat was **correctly** event-driven by the letter of §1. The events they
were each waiting for were **each other**. A QA-approved WP sat with no Decision
opened, and the ring would have held indefinitely: nothing was going to arrive.

⇒ **The rule §1 was missing is that a wait must have an ADDRESS.**

1. **When you hold, you must be able to name (a) the `evt_`/`dec_` id or the
   concrete act you are waiting for, and (b) the SEAT that owes it.** If you
   cannot name both, you are not event-driven — **you are stalled, and it is
   your job to find out, not to keep holding.**
2. **When you hand work back, name the owed act AND its owner explicitly.**
   *"Handed back to X"* is what created the deadlock above: it says who received
   it, not what they owe. Write *"@X owes the merge Decision on `<sha>`"*.
3. **A leader holding for a member must confirm the member is actually working**
   — pane, status, or post. §13's *delivery ≠ engagement* rule applies to your
   own ring, not only to kickoffs you receive.
4. **A ring silent with no member able to name its blocking event is the
   single cheapest stall to detect and the most expensive to miss.** Detect it
   at the ring, before the Steward's backstop is the only thing left.

**Why the backstop cannot be the answer:** the Steward's liveness sweep read
all three of those seats as BUSY for hours — a completed turn holding an
orphaned shell reads identical to a running one unless the detector is
specifically built to tell them apart. **A liveness instrument you did not
falsify in the false-BUSY direction reports "all clear" over exactly this.**
The ring knowing what it waits for is the primary mechanism; the watchdog is
insurance, and insurance failed.

## 2. Mention discipline

**Mention an agent iff you are (a) asking them a question or (b) expecting a
specific action/move from them — nothing else.** Every mention costs the
recipient tokens and fires a notification. Mentioning to *inform*,
*acknowledge*, *converge*, *confirm*, *affirm*, *CC an observer*, or *keep
someone in the loop* is **not** a permitted reason: if the recipient is not
being asked to answer or to do a next move, **do not mention them** — post it
un-mentioned so it lands in the context for whoever reads it, or don't post it
at all. (Operator, re-tightened 2026-07-03, second pass: a regression to
ack-with-mention crosstalk — "@X acknowledged / noted / tracked for later /
standing by" fires a notification for zero required action. This is the exact
pattern to eliminate; it binds every role, the Steward included.)

**A mootup mention is the *only* way you reach a teammate.** Every agent in the
federation is an **already-running, persistent peer** with its own always-on
session — never a sub-agent you launch. To delegate, query, hand off, or reach
*anyone*, **post a convo message mentioning them** (`post_response`, `mentions:
["<actor_id>"]`). **NEVER** spawn a teammate with the `Agent`/Task tool, a
subprocess, or `claude(prompt)` — that starts a fresh, unconfigured Claude (it
fails "503 provider not configured") and is not how this federation works. This
has bitten DeepSeek leaders mis-reading "hand the WP to your implementer" as a
launch instead of a mention. Assignment, query, handoff — all are mentions; local
git only.

- **RESOLVING AN `actor_id`: USE `scripts/moot-actor-id.sh <role>`. NEVER OPEN
  `.moot/actors.json` YOURSELF, AND NEVER DUMP IT TO LEARN ITS SHAPE.** That file
  holds every seat's `api_key` beside its `actor_id`. **Another seat's `api_key`
  is never yours to read** — only your own role's, and only for the HTTP fallback.
  **Both leaks so far happened during SCHEMA DISCOVERY, not during the
  lookup**: once by `sed`/`grep` over the raw file, once when a field-projecting
  one-liner returned nothing (the author had guessed the key names) and the author
  dumped the file *"just to see the structure"*, printing three records verbatim.
  ⇒ **A rule saying "project only the fields you need" does not bind the moment
  that leaks**, because you cannot write a projection until you know the field
  names. The script exists so you never need to look: it projects `actor_id` by
  name, enforces an **output whitelist** (nothing but `<role> agt_<id>` can leave
  it), and fails closed. `--list` prints the known role names; controls in
  `scripts/test-moot-actor-id.sh`. **If you must read the file for your own
  `api_key`, narrow by KEY NAMES ONLY — never print a value, never serialize a
  record.**
- Handoff that passes work to B → mention **B only**.
- "Your request is done," nothing pending → mention **nobody**.
- **A mention is a demand for attention; an ack is not — so never mention on an
  ack (operator, 2026-07-03).** You *may* post a brief **mention-free** ack for
  visibility (§4); the `mentions` field is reserved for the message whose *next
  move is the mentioned agent's*. Spend mentions only on real next-moves.
- **The escalation triangle (learned twice):** when you answer X's question but
  the *next move* belongs to Y, mention **Y**, not X. Naming Y in prose without
  a real mention is the classic silent stall.
- **Answering is not passive — a ruling / verdict / answer that moves the ball
  MUST mention whoever owns the next move, *including when that owner is the
  asker*.** The escalation triangle's blind spot: when your reply hands the move
  *back to the person who asked* (your design ruling → they author the WP; your
  review verdict → they apply the fix or merge), it feels like you are "just
  answering," so you mention no one. But that answer **expects the asker's next
  action** — which is exactly the §2(b) mention case. Populate the `mentions`
  array (not a prose `@name`, which fires no notification — §2a). Observed
  2026-07-11: three Architect design rulings that answered the Steward's
  questions each posted with an **empty `mentions` array** and no in-text
  address → invisible to the asker's `get_mentions`, surfaced only by manual
  thread-polling, so every one of them was a latent silent stall. **If your post
  moves the ball to anyone — asker or third party — mention them.**
- **Route an action-expecting mention only to a *live* agent — never a `moot
  init` template placeholder (promoted B1, spec-leader's catch).** The space
  carries dead template participants (`Spec`, `Leader`, `QA`, `Implementation`,
  …) left by scaffolding; a review/handoff/kickoff mention routed to one is a
  **silent no-op** — it wakes no one. The tell: a placeholder is
  `participant_type: agent` with **`agent_adapter: null`** (no recent
  `last_seen_at`); a running agent has `agent_adapter: "mcp"`. Before routing a
  vote/handoff to a participant you didn't just hear from, confirm it's live
  (`list_participants`). This was the mechanism behind the Sec1ct §14 breach —
  "Spec review" routed to the dead `Spec` placeholder, so the gate never ran.
- **Post in plain text. No decorative icons** (operator, 2026-08-01). Do not
  open a post, heading, bullet, or emphasis with star, warning sign, no-entry,
  check mark, or any emoji. **The operator reads this channel and finds them
  distracting rather than helpful.** Emphasis comes from **bold**, from
  structure, and from leading with the point. Symbols that carry information
  stay — arrows in a derivation, math and Ken notation, and terminal glyphs
  quoted as data. If deleting it would lose information, it is not decoration.
  Full statement: `AGENTS.md` Conventions.
- **Thread your reply — don't scatter to the space root** (operator 2026-06-29;
  hardened 2026-07-03; **restated 2026-08-01 — top level is a closed list:
  `steward`, `librarian`, `research`, and nobody else. Every other role always
  threads. A thread's identity is a WP, and the kick's own `event_id` is its
  anchor — §4**). Every event you receive carries a `thread_id`. When you respond
  to a message that belongs to a thread — a kickoff, assignment, query, handoff,
  review request, or retro call — **reply *into that thread*** (`post_response` with
  `thread_id` set to that message's thread; or `parent_event_id` on the first
  reply, which opens the thread). A bare `post_response` with no thread drops
  your message at the space root, **scattering one WP's conversation across the
  space** so the next reader — and the Steward harvesting retros — can't follow
  the exchange. **One WP = one thread:** kickoff → ack → queries → handoff →
  merge Decision → retros all live under it. **`reply_to` needs an *existing*
  thread** — it 404s ("Thread not found") on a **top-level** event that has no
  thread yet (e.g. a kickoff, which is itself a root post). To **open** a thread
  on such an event, use `post_response` with `parent_event_id` set to it; use
  `reply_to` only for an event **already in** a thread. (L5: an implementer lost a
  round-trip when `reply_to` on the kickoff 404'd.)

### 2a. Convo call cheat-sheet (form valid parameters — recurring failure)

Malformed convo calls fail **silently to the workflow** (the post never lands,
so the next move never fires). The two parameters that get rejected:

- **`message_type` MUST be one of the backend enum values** — guessing a
  natural-language type is a 400 reject. **Valid:** `question`, `code_share`,
  `git_request`, `review_request`, `retro`, `status_update`, `bug`, `feature`,
  `decision_propagated`, `pause_issued`, `connection_status`. **REJECTED (do not
  use):** `message`, `kickoff`, `assignment`, `merge_ready`, `handoff`, `nudge`,
  `ack`. Map your *intent* to a valid type:
  | Intent | `message_type` |
  |---|---|
  | kickoff / assign a WP / hand work to a teammate / deliver code | `code_share` |
  | question / query / nudge / ack / general note | `question` |
  | ask for publisher-path merge handling | `git_request` |
  | QA→leader merge-Decision request; "request review" | `review_request` |
  | a retro bullet-set | `retro` |
  | a status line | `status_update` |
  | a defect note to another team | `bug` |
  When unsure, **`question`** is always accepted. If you get
  `unknown message_type '<x>'`, re-send with the mapped value — don't drop the post.
- **`mentions` MUST be a list of participant_ids** — `mentions: ["agt_…"]`, the
  raw IDs resolved from `list_participants` / `orientation()`. **Not** display
  names (`["spec-leader"]` ✗), **not** `@name` in the `text` (that fires no
  notification — §2), **not** a bare string. One id per actor whose move is next.
- **`propose_decision`**: give the decision `text`/title + the WP/branch; mention
  the required reviewers (Architect always; Spec only on `spec/`+`conformance/`
  paths — §13/diff-scope). **`thread_id`/`parent_event_id`** take an event/thread
  id string (§2), never a name. **`reply_to` 404s on an un-threaded (top-level)
  event** — to thread under a kickoff, use `post_response` + `parent_event_id`,
  not `reply_to` (§2). When a call 400s/404s, **read the error, fix the one named
  field, and re-send** — a dropped post is a silent stall.

## 3. Status = what you're doing, in your own words

Three liveness signals exist; only the third is yours to post:
1. connection (automatic — never post "I'm online");
2. activity (file/transcript mtime — automatic);
3. **semantic status** — "drafting K2 conversion", "blocked-on-spec: OQ-17".
   Agent-composed, never auto-classified.

**Update your status on _every_ change in your activity (operator, 2026-07-03).**
Not just at handoff boundaries — whenever what you are doing changes: picking up a
WP, starting a sub-step, finishing, changing focus, going idle, blocking,
unblocking. Your status line is the federation's **at-a-glance truth**
(`list_participants`) and the Steward's primary watchdog signal; a status that
lags your real activity is a coordination hazard — it reads as *stalled* when you
are working, or *working* when you are already done, and sends the watchdog
chasing phantom stalls (or missing real ones). Treat the `update_status` call as
**part of every activity transition**, the same reflex as saving a file — cheap,
frequent, always current. This is the low-cost, always-on signal that lets the
rest of the discipline below (mention-free acks, Steward-only roots) stay quiet.

## 4. Threads are the spine

> ### THE WHOLE RULE IN FOUR LINES (operator, 2026-08-01)
>
> 1. **A thread's identity is a WP.** One WP = one thread, opened by its **kick**.
> 2. **The kick's own `event_id` IS the thread anchor.** Everything about that WP
>    replies under it — nothing about it is ever posted anywhere else.
> 3. **A rescope that SPLITS a WP abandons the original thread.** Each component
>    WP gets a fresh kick and therefore a fresh thread.
> 4. **Only `steward`, `librarian`, and `research` may post at top level.**
>    Every other role always replies into a thread.

**Read the anchor rule literally: the anchor is an `evt_`, not a `thr_`.** That is
not a stylistic choice — see the mechanism note below, which is why the corollary
"every kick carries a thread id" cannot be implemented as stated.

### 4a. THE MECHANISM — a thread does not exist until someone replies

**Measured 2026-08-01, and it defeats the obvious reading of the rule.** A
kick is by construction a **root post**: `post_response` with no parent returns
`thread_id: null`, because **the thread is minted by the first reply**, not by
the root. The root event is then pulled into that thread retroactively.

⇒ **A kick therefore CANNOT quote the thread id it is inaugurating — no such
id exists at the moment it is written.** **The exact substitute, which loses
nothing: the kick's own `event_id` is the anchor, and every recipient already has
it** (it is in the mention notification and in the events feed).

| you are… | you call | why |
|---|---|---|
| the **first** reply to a kick | `post_response(parent_event_id=<kick evt_>)` | this **opens** the thread. `reply_to` **404s** ("Thread not found") on a root event that has no thread yet |
| any **later** poster | `post_response(thread_id=<thr_>)` or `reply_to(<any evt_ already in the thread>)` | the thread now exists |
| posting a **new WP kick** (steward/librarian/research only) | bare `post_response`, no parent, no thread | you are creating the anchor |

**`reply_to` auto-mentions the original speaker.** That is load-bearing:
on 2026-08-01 the Runtime ring deadlocked because an Architect verdict mentioned
only the implementer and not the leader who opened the Decision. Replying into
the thread makes the wake path structural instead of a habit someone must
remember.

### 4b. What every kick must carry

**Every WP kick — and every doc-phase kick — must state its own anchor in its
body**, in words a recipient can act on without a lookup:

> **This message is the thread anchor for `<WP-ID>`.** Reply with
> `parent_event_id` set to **this event's id**; thereafter use its `thread_id`.
> Do not open a second thread for this WP and do not post about it at the
> space root.

**A kick without that line is defective** — reissue it rather than letting the
ring guess.

### 4c. Rescope: when the thread is abandoned

| what happened | thread disposition |
|---|---|
| WP **split** into components (a §5a-iii recut, a mis-sizing outcome (c)) | **abandon the original thread.** Post one final line in it naming the successor WP ids, then **a fresh kick — and so a fresh thread — per component WP** |
| WP **rescoped in place** (scope amended, hard stop ruled, deliverable added) | **keep the thread.** Nothing was split, so the WP's identity is unchanged |
| WP **respun** (new candidate SHA after a reject) | **keep the thread.** A rejected candidate is not a new WP |
| work **routed** to another WP (a `D4` route, an inherited obligation) | **keep both threads.** The route is a reply in the *origin* thread; the obligation lands in the *target* WP's **frame**, not as a cross-post |
| WP **merged**, retros posted | **the thread is CLOSED.** It takes no further posts, ever |

**The test is "did the set of WPs change?"** — not "did anything change?" Only
a split changes it.

> ### A MERGED WP'S THREAD IS CLOSED — and this is where the rule actually breaks
>
> **Measured 2026-08-01, one hour after this section landed.** Runtime QA
> posted **`QA APPROVED — Slice 2 exact ed527eb7…`** into **slice 1's** thread.

> the Steward releases the next slice, the previous slice's thread is done.

### 4d. Top-level is a closed list

**`steward`, `librarian`, `research` — nobody else, ever** (operator,
2026-08-01; supersedes the Steward-only rule of 2026-07-03). A post from any
other role *always* carries a `thread_id` or `parent_event_id`.

The three are exactly the roles whose output is **not scoped to one WP**: the
Steward coordinates across all of them, the Librarian holds a standing as-built
mandate over the whole corpus, and research reports are corpus-wide by nature.

**Everyone else, including the Architect and every team leader, threads.** An
Architect ruling about a WP belongs in that WP's thread. **A general design
ruling that belongs to no WP is the one real gap** — route it to the Steward,
who opens a thread for it; do not root it yourself.

After any context reset/compaction, **resolve the live thread from fresh
context**; do not reuse a thread/event id from a summarized memory — the
single commonest cause of a days-old thread being revived is a stale id carried
through a compaction.

The rationale is structural, not stylistic: **the Steward is the coordinator of
all activity, so any work another agent does traces back — by origin — to a
message the Steward sent.** Enforcing it makes the whole space a clean tree
rooted at coordination posts and ends the fragmentation where parallel root posts
scatter one WP's exchange. Consequences:
- **Reply, never root.** Use `post_response`/`share` with the WP thread's
  `thread_id` (or `parent_event_id` on the kickoff to open its thread); never a
  bare un-parented post. The mechanics are unchanged (§2's `reply_to`-vs-
  `parent_event_id` note still holds) — what changes is that rooting is now
  **prohibited** for non-Steward roles, not merely discouraged.
- **No home thread? Route to the Steward, don't root it.** If you have something
  that fits no existing thread (a genuinely new cross-cutting concern), thread it
  under the nearest relevant Steward post — or the standing `steward:` coordination
  thread — mentioning the Steward if a decision is needed. The Steward owns thread
  creation and will open a new root if the item warrants its own spine. A spun-off
  WP (its own branch + gates + merge, e.g. an erratum) is still opened as its own
  spine — **by the Steward**, per the WP-release process — with a one-line pointer
  from the parent.
- **Decisions, questions, reviews still thread.** `propose_decision`,
  `question`, `review_request`, `git_request`, and `retro` all attach to the
  relevant WP thread (their `thread_id`/`parent_event_id`, §2a); the Steward-only
  rule governs *root chat posts*, and these governance objects are never a reason
  to open a new root.

**Threading drifts in exactly two ways (operator 2026-07-02) — guard both.**
(1) **A fork spawns a side-thread.** A mid-WP escalation — a soundness fork to
the Architect, a scope fork to the Steward, a conformance fork to CV — is a
**reply *in* the WP thread** (the `mention` routes it to the owner); opening a
fresh root for the ruling scatters the WP across threads even though every
message was correctly *addressed*. The ruling and its answer belong under the
kickoff. (2) **A new WP reuses the *previous* WP's thread.** By reflex (or
post-compaction) an agent replies in the most-recently-active thread — usually
the *last*, now-closed WP's — instead of the current WP's kickoff. "Resolve the
live thread from fresh context" means **the current WP's kickoff root, not the
most-recent thread**; the kickoff event you were mentioned on *is* the anchor,
and a kickoff **states its own anchor** ("thread all `<WP>` activity here") so
there is nothing to guess. The only sanctioned *new* thread off a WP is a
genuinely separate spun-off WP (its own branch + gates + merge, e.g. an
erratum): open it as its own spine with a one-line pointer from the parent.

**Post at both boundaries — on receiving work and on handing off (operator,
2026-06-29).** When you **pick up** a task, post a brief *taking-this* note in its
WP thread and set your semantic status to it (§3); when you **finish or hand
off**, post what you did + the mention of whoever moves next (§2) and update your
status again. **Both signals — the in-thread post *and* the status — at both
ends, not just at handoff.** The boundary posts keep the flow legible in the web
view and preserve the interaction history; without them there is a silent gap
between assignment and completion that no one can audit or replay.

**Acks are allowed — but never with a mention (operator, 2026-07-03; refines the
earlier "no bare acks").** The problem was never the acknowledgment itself — it
was that a **mention fires a notification and *obligates* the recipient** to spend
tokens reading and deciding whether to respond. So the rule is about the
*mention*, not the *post*: **a mention is a demand for attention; an ack demands
nothing, so an ack MUST mention no one.** Concretely:
- **You MAY post a brief, mention-free ack in a thread** — "seen", "picked this
  up", "proceeding", "noted, folding in" — so that anyone scanning the thread, and
  the Steward harvesting flow, can *see* the activity without anyone being pinged.
  A mention-free ack is a **passive visibility signal**, not noise: it does not
  interrupt or obligate a soul.
- **Reserve `mentions` strictly for the message whose *next move is the mentioned
  agent's*** (§2) — a handoff, a blocking question, a finding they must act on.
  **Never @mention on a mere ack** — that manufactures a false obligation and is
  the exact interruption the earlier rule was reaching for.
- **Silence is still fine.** If you need nothing back and diverge on nothing, you
  may simply proceed and let the next *substantive* post (candidate-ready, a
  finding, a handoff) be your acknowledgment. Mention-free ack and silence are now
  **both acceptable**; the audit trail is still carried by the substantive posts +
  your always-current status (§3), and the hard line is unchanged only in its
  sharpened form: **the mention, not the post, is the scarce resource — spend it
  only on a real next-move.**

Note this pairs with the two rules above: **every activity change updates your
status** (§3, the always-on signal) and **only the Steward roots a thread** (every
ack is therefore a mention-free *reply* inside an existing thread). Together they
let an agent broadcast "I'm alive and moving" through cheap, non-interrupting
channels — status + threaded mention-free ack — reserving mentions for genuine
handoffs.

**A mention is never an acknowledgment (operator, 2026-07-03, second pass).**
The regression that keeps recurring is an ack that *also* mentions — "@X
acknowledged," "@X noted, tracked for later," "@X standing by," "@X converged,
agree." Even when the prose feels substantive, if the recipient is not being
**asked** or **tasked**, the mention is pure notification-noise. So: if your only
reason to name someone is to tell them you received / agree with / are proceeding
on their message, mention **no one** and post **nothing** — proceed silently
(silence is acceptance, above). Reserve every mention for a question or an
expected next move (§2 opening). When you *do* have a substantive routing post
(a decision, a finding, a handoff), mention **only** the one actor whose move is
next — not the observers you're "keeping in the loop" (they read the context).
This applies to the Steward's own posts as much as anyone's.

**Title convention (the single-space articulation tag).** The whole federation
runs in one space (`ken-topos`), so a thread's **title is its team tag** — there
is no separate per-team channel. Begin every kickoff title with a tag, then a
terse subject:

- **Work-package threads:** the WP ID, whose letter encodes the owning team —
  `K*` Kernel · `V*` Verify · `L*` Language · `X*` Runtime · `Sec*` security ·
  `B*` seam · `T*` tooling · `F*` foundation. E.g. `K2: decidable conversion`.
- **Non-WP threads** (a cross-team query, a process/retro note): prefix with the
  originating role/team and an arrow if it targets one — `steward: cadence
  pass`, `kernel→spec: OQ on cast normal form`.

This makes the one space scannable and `search_spaces`-filterable by team
without the cost of per-team spaces, and pairs with the `message_type` taxonomy
(§8): the title says *who/what*, the type says *what kind*, and `list_threads`
filters on type with per-actor unread counts. Keep both accurate.

## 5. Decisions are for judgment, not deduction

Open a mootup Decision (`propose_decision`) for choices with tradeoffs where a
reasonable peer might differ — kernel/semantics design, an API shape, a
content-store policy. Do **not** open one for deductive/mechanical choices (a
bug fix is not a decision). Decisions are how future agents query *why* Ken is
the way it is. **Merge/review approvals are also Decisions** — the merge
Decision *is* the review record (see `04-git-and-integration.md`).

## 6. Resolve when structurally determined; escalate only real forks

Before escalating or querying another team, ask: *is there a strategic choice
between materially different futures?* If **no** — the published spec + kernel
invariants + existing code already determine the answer; resolve it yourself and
record the resolution with a cited rationale (`file:line` or spec §). If **yes**
— escalate. For clean-room questions, "the published spec" means `/spec`, never
prototype source. This filter is the volume control on the cross-team query
edges (§11): without it, Spec and the Architect become bottlenecks.

## 7. Ground every premise before locking

Before locking a spec, ADR, or design claim, verify each premise against
reality: "X exists" → grep for it; "matches pattern Y" → read Y end-to-end. For
a *verified* language a spec claim about the kernel must be checked against the
kernel, not assumed.

### 7a. MUTABLE EXTERNAL STATE IS TESTED AT POINT OF USE, NEVER CITED

Grounding a premise in a **document** works for facts that are true by
construction — what a function does, what a spec says. It **fails** for
**credentials, permissions, scopes, quotas, remote refs, and infrastructure**,
because those change *without touching any file that describes them.* Nothing
goes red when such a note goes stale; the note simply becomes false in place.

**Measured, 2026-07-22.** A finished, QA-approved WP was declared undeliverable
by **two seats independently** — one citing a fleet memory note, one citing
`docs/ops/runbook-gh-identities.md:109` — both saying the publisher App lacked
`Workflows` permission. **The operator had granted it the day before.** The
Steward escalated and asked for a permission that already existed.

The disconfirming evidence was in the repository the entire time: three commits
under `.github/workflows/` authored by that very App.

**Two rules, and the second is the one that was actually missing:**

1. **Test it.** A capability question — *"can this credential push that path?"*
   — is answered by attempting it, usually in one command. **Never escalate a
   capability claim you have not tried.**
2. **When an observation contradicts a record, the RECORD is what you
   re-verify — not the observation you explain away.** `verify-leader` found the
   three commits, held both facts side by side, and wrote *"I can't tell which;
   flagging that I don't know rather than guessing."* **That is the correct
   move and it is what got this corrected.** The Steward saw the same evidence
   and explained it away as "probably operator-pushed" — reconciling the anomaly
   *to* the record instead of testing the record against the anomaly.

⇒ A note about mutable state is **evidence about the past**, carrying a
timestamp whether or not one is written. Cite it to form a hypothesis; never to
close a question. And when you find such a note false, **fix it in place and say
when it became false** — a silently corrected doc teaches the next reader
nothing.

### 7b. NEVER DEFAULT A VALUE YOUR WHOLE CONCLUSION RESTS ON

Related failure, same day, three instances: an operand chosen without checking
which point in the graph it sat at (`dd715950^` — a point on `main`'s history —
used to answer a question about a *PR's base*); a precedent asserted from a
branch **name** rather than its diff; a claim about a file cited from another
seat's characterization rather than by opening the line.

Each returned a **confident, wrong** answer rather than an obviously broken one.
⇒ **Read the assertion back out of the artifact, and check the operand sits at
the point in the graph your question is about.**

**Verify the *property*, not the representative case (promoted from F4 + K1).**
A passing obvious-case test and correct *prose* are **false signals** — the
algorithm or code can still be wrong in the cases you didn't exercise. (F4: a
Map/Set determinism test passed only because `BTreeMap` pre-sorts, never
exercising the encoder's own sort. K1: the positivity conformance tested only
direct arrow-domain negativity and missed the hidden-negative classes — `Pair
(Bad3→Empty) Unit` — that the Architect caught; the §8.2 *prose* was right while
the *algorithm* silently dropped those positions, a soundness hole in the trust
root.) So — for QA, conformance authoring, spec authoring, and review alike:
when an algorithm has N guard/discard positions, **exercise each independently**
(one case per guard) plus one where the problem hides behind indirection; write
algorithmic pseudocode **defensively** (every discarding position
explicit-guarded, every guard backed by a rejection case). The obvious case
passing ≠ the property holds.

**A discriminator boundary needs a non-degenerate *pair*, not a positive case
(promoted Sec1/Sec1ct/V3/B1 — ≥4 domains, build *and* spec enclave).** When a
rule, classification, projection, or lattice-axis *orientation* decides between
two outcomes on a boundary (accept/reject, `proved`/`assumed`, taint/safe), a
single positive case is **green-vs-green** under the exact swap it should catch:
flip the order/orientation and the lone case still passes, for the wrong reason.
The net is **one non-degenerate pair on a *shared* input** — the two states that
must bucket differently, identical in every other respect (Sec1ct: a `ct⊤` value
rejects *while* a `Secret`-not-`@ct` value accepts on the *same* sink shape; B1:
a `proved` claim maps to `Q` *while* a hole maps to `P` on the *same*
postcondition) — so a flipped boundary inverts **both** and the pair fails. And
the discriminator the case keys on must be a **structural / kernel-side signal**
(`trusted_base()` membership, a constructor, a real value through a real sink),
never a **self-reported string** the untrusted layer can forge.

**Exhaustive-by-construction: make load-bearing completeness a *compile error*,
not a test (promoted across the V-spine + X1-effects; verify-team-requested).**
When the **completeness** of an enumeration is load-bearing — every obligation
classified, every effect dispatched, every verdict projected, every variant
handled — encode it as a **single `match` over a sealed type with NO `_ =>`
catch-all arm**, so adding a variant without handling it is a **compile error**,
not a silent drop. This is *structural*, stronger than any test: it's the
constructive form of the two-soundnesses *omission* backstop (a silently-skipped
case supplies nothing for a downstream checker to catch). Validated at four tiers
— V2 `lift_obligation` (no `_=>` over `ObligationKind`), V3 `classify` (HO is the
**explicit** default arm, not a skip), V4 `project_diagnostic` (one `match` over
`Verdict`, no relabel path), and X1-effects `drive_h` (sealed effect-class enum →
new variant = compile error, out-of-row tag → honest `panic!`). Reach for a
catch-all **only** where the residual is genuinely uniform; where completeness is
the safeguard, an explicit arm per variant is the safeguard. Implementer writes
it; QA + the Architect verify **no `_ =>`** sits on a completeness-critical match.

## 8. Message-type taxonomy (routing metadata)

Tag each message with a type; the **first line is the thread title** — no
`[TYPE]` prefix in the body. The type MUST be a **backend enum value** — see the
**§2a mapping table** for the valid set and how to map your intent. In
particular, a local `wp/<ID>` branch ready for publisher-path merge handling is
`git_request` (the old `merge_ready` is rejected), and a QA→leader
merge-Decision request is `review_request`. When unsure, `question` is always
accepted.

## 8a. ARCHITECT AND LIBRARIAN ARE PARALLEL, OVER DISJOINT DOMAINS

**Operator directive, 2026-07-22.** They review **at the same time**, each in
their own domain, and **they should not need to interact.**

| reviewer | domain |
|---|---|
| **Architect** | `catalog/`, `crates/` |
| **Librarian** | `library/` |

**Neither is a gate on the other, and neither's approval is a precondition for
the other starting.** A candidate touching both domains goes to **both at once**.

### The rule that actually saves the time

**A fold in one domain does NOT invalidate the other domain's approval.**
An approval binds the exact SHA **for its own domain**. When a fold touches only
`crates/`, the Librarian's `library/` approval **carries forward** — re-run the
Librarian only if the fold touched `library/`.

**This is why it matters, measured on SRC-ATTEST 2026-07-22:** the WP was gated
*Librarian QA → Architect*, in series. Three Architect rejections, each landing
in `scripts/`, each sending the candidate **back through a full Librarian
re-review of `library/` that no fold had touched.** Every review found something
real — the serialization was not catching bugs, it was **re-asking a question
already answered** while the fleet's top priority sat blocked behind it. Roughly
an hour, entirely in the handoff, not in the work.

⇒ **Serial review across disjoint domains buys nothing and costs a full
round-trip per iteration.** If two reviewers cannot invalidate each other's
finding, they must not be sequenced.

### Assembling parallel verdicts

- Each reviewer votes on the **exact SHA** for **their** domain, and says which
  domain they bound.
- The **owning leader** assembles: the candidate is ready when **every touched
  domain has a live approval on the current SHA**.
- On a fold, the leader re-requests **only the domains the fold touched** —
  and must state which approvals it is carrying forward, so a stale carry-forward
  is visible rather than assumed.

### A candidate is accepted work, not a finished WP

Operator, 2026-08-06: *"From now on, merge in accepted work once it is done,
even if it is only a partial WP."*

**Do not wait for a WP's remaining deliverables before assembling a
candidate.** Once a deliverable is complete and every touched domain has a live
approval on its exact SHA, it is a candidate — route it to the Steward to
publish. WP closure and merge are separate events, and a leader holding
finished work for its unfinished siblings is the thing this rule retires.

**The one bar is semantic atomicity**: a declared atomic pair lands together,
because one half regresses alone or has no reaching witness alone. That is a
property of the work, and it is the only qualifying reason. "The branch carries
the evidence chain", "a rebase would cost re-anchoring", and "a working path
would go red" are not bars (see §12 and the 2026-07-28 no-users ruling).

**Prefer a cut that is a straight ancestor of the working tip** — a contiguous
prefix preserves every exact SHA and every review verdict below it with no
rebase, so verdict transfer is paid only on what is still in flight.

**A reviewed prefix is not thereby a releasable one.** Checkpoint approvals
bind an exact SHA for a deliverable's own claim; none of them asserts the tree
is green there, because nobody asked. Establish greenness on the cut **and** on
`main` before routing a candidate, so a red is attributable rather than
inherited. Measured 2026-08-06: a complete, fully-reviewed 34-commit prefix of
`RT-DECL-CLOSURE-PORT` failed eight CI checks against a green `main`. The
node-id boundary is bookkeeping; greenness is semantic, and the two need not
coincide.

**`scripts/` and `agent/` are not in the operator's split.** Until the operator
rules, treat publisher/tooling changes under `scripts/` as the **Architect's**
review surface (machinery, not library content) and `agent/` as the **Steward's**
own. **This paragraph is the Steward's inference, not an operator ruling** —
flagged as such so it is cheap to correct.

## 9. Topology is invariant — including the query edges

Who hands off to whom, who reviews, who merges, and **which cross-team query
edges exist** is operator-owned and fixed. The sanctioned edges are exactly:

- any team → **Spec** leader — behavioral-contract questions ("what must this do
  to be correct?").
- any team → **Architect** — component-design questions ("how should I structure
  this / which design?").
- any team → **Steward** — scope/priority (forwarded to the operator),
  workflow/process, and research requests.
- any team → **Steward** — merge status or publisher-path workflow questions.
- any team → **Steward** — `git_request`: a ready WP branch for publisher-path
  merge. The Steward is the **sole merge router** — route every `git_request`
  there. No other seat holds a GitHub credential.

**There is NO enclave → build-team edge — the enclave elaborates autonomously
(operator, 2026-07-03).** The clean-room enclave (spec-leader / spec-author / CV)
is the authority for `/spec` + `/conformance` elaboration; it does **not** pull a
build-team member (a team's leader / implementer / QA) into an elaboration
thread. When elaboration needs a **fact about landed code** — "is this heap tag /
symbol / primitive referenced anywhere?" — the enclave **greps the code itself**
(grounding against landed code is standard enclave practice, §7), never asks a
build lead. When it needs a cross-cutting **judgment** call, it routes to
**Architect** (the `any → Architect` edge — soundness/means span lanes), never to
a build-team leader. *Live catch (Map elaboration): spec-author @mentioned
runtime-leader to confirm a heap-tag (`0x07`/`0x08`) retirement was inert — a
grep-able fact (`canonical.rs:23-24`, zero refs), and the coupled soundness call
was Architect's. Self-ground or route-to-Architect; don't cross into the build
lane.*

Agents may improve *what they do inside a node*, never *add a communication edge
or a review cycle* between nodes. When integrating a retro lesson, reject any
carry-forward that would add/move an edge — and do not soften the rejection to
"candidate, watch one more run." That softening is how coordination entropy
creeps in.

**The invariant is traffic, not just edges — trust the simple flow.** The base
flow is deliberately thin, and it *works*: **spec** — Steward frames →
spec-leader assembles → spec-author writes → CV (Spec vote) + Architect
(soundness vote), one pass each → publisher path merges. **build** — Steward
frames → leader frames the team WP → implementer builds → QA verifies →
Architect (soundness) + CV (conformance) → publisher path merges. Two reviewers
per WP, one
pass each; a mid-WP fork goes to the **one** owner of its lane
(soundness → Architect, conformance → CV, scope/process → Steward) who rules —
others do **not** pile onto the thread. Coordination entropy creeps in *below*
the edge level: **more parties cc'd on a thread, verbatim relays, "flagging in
parallel," "cross-checking with," a committee where one decider suffices,
pre-confirming what a gate will already check.** None of these adds a new
*edge*, so the edge-filter above misses them — but each multiplies tokens on
**every future WP**, and the enclave is serial, so the cost compounds. Treat
added *traffic* exactly like an added edge: it is **very expensive** (paid
per-WP, forever) and it is the **operator's to sanction** — never a retro's to
add. Default: **route to one, trust the gate, don't convene the room.** When in
doubt, the thinner flow is the right one.

### 9a. Assign spillover work; never negotiate it (operator-directed)

A sound change often forces **spillover** work in another team's file — a
companion proof-term migration, a downstream fixup that must land in the **same
PR**. **That work attaches to the WP-owner by default: whoever owns the branch's
PR/Decision assigns it, unilaterally, in one message.** Cross-team
file-familiarity is an *input* the owner may weigh, never a competing claim to
route around them.

Do **not** assign spillover work by **offer-form** ("you take it" / "no, you
take it"). Offer-form between two leaders is bilaterally unstable — each reply
answers the other's *prior* message, so they cross and ping-pong (a companion
migration once flipped ownership four times in one minute; it has recurred). A
fixed assigner has no cross-wire: one message settles it.

**Silence = assent on a settled handoff.** Only the assigner posts the
assignment; the assignee acks **once**; downstream nodes do **not** each
re-confirm, and no one relays a "you look stale" fan-in — a single correction to
the assigner suffices. When your own assertion turns out stale, **retract and
defer** in one message: a clean withdrawal ends a ping-pong; a second asserted
correction extends it.

This is a fixed *assignment* rule, not a new edge — it **removes** edges (the
whole negotiation cluster) rather than adding one.

## 10⁻. PROCESS WORK IS SUBORDINATE TO PRODUCT FLOW — the Steward's hard ceiling

**Measured, 2026-07-22.** Between 17:10 and 19:45 — **two and a half hours** —
every one of eleven merges to `main` was process: five memory files, three
publisher-script changes, one playbook, one frame, one tracker sync, plus a
`library/REVISION` bump that existed only to repair `main` after one of those
merges reddened it. **Zero touched `crates/`, `spec/`, or `conformance/`.**
Meanwhile a QA-approved verify WP sat undelivered and a QA-clean runtime WP sat
held. The operator noticed from outside and asked what was going on.

**Nothing external was pulling that work. The chain was self-sustaining:** a
publisher bug produced a playbook lesson, which produced a memory promotion,
which produced an adversary finding, which produced a frame, which produced an
Architect escalation. **Every link was individually correct and defensible.**
That is precisely why it ran unchecked — there was no step at which the right
local decision was to stop. The Steward was both producer and consumer, so the
loop had no external brake.

⇒ **The corpus exists to make the build better. When it competes with the build,
it has inverted its purpose.** Three binding rules:

1. **NO process merge while a ring holds finished, unmerged work.** If any WP
   is QA-approved-and-unpublished, or held on the Steward, **that is the queue** —
   playbook edits, memory promotions, and corpus refactors wait. A finished WP
   that cannot land is the most expensive object in the federation: it has
   consumed a full ring's build + review + QA and is returning nothing.
2. **Retro and lesson artifacts BATCH; they do not each get a merge.** A lesson
   is not perishable — it is equally true an hour later. Accumulate them and land
   them in one publish at a genuine seam. **Publishing them individually converts
   reflection into throughput and makes a stalled fleet look busy** — from the
   outside, an active merge stream is indistinguishable from progress.
3. **A process change must name the product WP it unblocks, or wait.** If you
   cannot name one, it is not urgent by definition. Watch for the inverted
   form specifically: *"I must harden this mechanism before I can safely use
   it."* That reasoning is how the loop above sustained itself, and it is
   **almost always** an invitation to do the process work first — check whether
   the mechanism has actually failed on the work in front of you, or whether you
   are hardening it against an imagined future call.

**The tell, and it is available in one command:** `git log --since=<3h ago>
origin/main` with paths. **If nothing in the window touched product, stop and
find out why** — the answer is never "the corpus needed attention." It is
usually that a ring is stalled and something is reporting it as fine.

## 10⁻a. THE ADVERSARY CHANNEL IS REPORT-ONLY AND SCOPED TO PRODUCT

**Operator directive, 2026-07-22.** §10⁻ named the failure — a high-quality
finding stream plus a Steward who services it immediately is a mechanism for
crowding out product — but left the Steward to police themselves, which is the
one thing the failure mode guarantees will not work. **This is the structural
version, and it binds the edge rather than the intention.**

### Scope — what the adversary may report on

| may report | may NOT report |
|---|---|
| **`crates/`** — Ken's implementation | `scripts/` — publisher, harnesses, tooling |
| **catalog / `library/`** issues | `agent/` — playbooks, COORDINATION, memory |
| | process, workflow, coordination mechanics |
| | anything else |

**A report outside that scope is out of scope even if it is correct, cheap,
and load-bearing.** The value of the finding is not the test — the *scope* is
the test. Tooling and process defects are found by the ring that trips over
them, in the course of product work, or they wait.

### Traffic — the complete permitted set

The edge is **report-only and one-directional**. In full:

1. The Steward **may notify** the adversary on a code merge.
2. The Steward **may receive** reports.
3. **Nothing else.**

**No acknowledgement.** No "taken", no "committed as `<sha>`", no thanks, no
routing note, no explanation of why something was queued, no correction of the
adversary's framing, and **no reply of any kind** — including a reply whose
content is that no reply is owed. **Do not answer a report.** Act on it inside
product work, or do not.

**No conversation, no thread.** Do not ask the adversary to hunt something,
do not confirm a finding, do not agree or disagree with it in the channel, and
do not invite follow-up. **A request for an attack is a conversation** — the
Steward does not make one.

**Why the ack is banned specifically, since it is the part that will feel
wrong to withhold:** the acknowledgement is where the servicing loop restarts.
It costs a message, invites a reply, converts a report into a thread, and every
step is individually courteous. **The prohibition is the mechanism; a Steward
who may reply "just this once" has no rule at all.**

## 10. Knowledge promotion: retro → synthesis → promotion ladder

- **The retro is a mandatory step, not an afterthought.** A work package is not
  *done* until its retro is in. The moment a WP's work is verified/merged, every
  working agent in the ring (implementer, QA; spec-author,
  conformance-validator) posts a short **`retro`** in the WP's thread — three
  bullets: **trap** (what cost time, or a defect the process caught or missed),
  **held** (a discipline that worked, with its prior-run validation count if it
  has one), and **carry** (a candidate rule to promote). Tag each bullet
  node-internal or topology-touching, so the Steward's invariance filter (§9) is
  pre-sorted.
- **The leader collects and hands off.** When a WP merges, the team leader
  confirms each working agent's retro landed, adds a one-bullet coordination
  retro, and posts a `retro`-typed "retros in" to the Steward with the WP ID and
  pointers. 15-min timeout: hand off what is in and name who is missing. This
  rides the existing team→Steward workflow edge (§9) — it adds no new edge.
- The **Steward** harvests retros across teams and promotes lessons up a ladder
  (see the steward playbook): team-local → archetype source → this file.
- A lesson promotes only when it passes all three: **(a) validated across ≥3
  runs *or* independently in ≥2 teams, (b) effort-/model-/operator-agnostic, (c)
  a normative rule, not a one-off fact.** Exception: an explicit operator
  correction promotes on a single data point. On promotion, retire the source
  note atomically. Cross-team replication is a *stronger* generalization signal
  than single-team repetition — use it.
- **(d) The ratchet guard — retros only ever *add*.** No retro proposes
  *removing* a hop; each says "also loop in X," "relay verbatim so nothing's
  lost," "cross-check Y in parallel." Every one is locally sensible and
  collectively ruinous — absent a hard default the communication topology
  monotonically complexifies. So any carry that adds a communication **party,
  relay, gate, or confirm-hop** is **topology-touching (§9)**: it does **not**
  promote on validation alone — it needs **explicit operator consent**, exactly
  like a new edge. Prefer the node-internal form every time: sharpen *what* an
  existing reviewer checks, never *who else* gets looped in. The bias is toward
  the **thinner** flow; simplifying it back is the Steward's standing mandate,
  complicating it is the operator's call alone.

## 11. Cross-team query protocol

The edges in §9 are thin synchronous couplings between otherwise-parallel rings.
Use them sparingly and always event-driven:

1. **Filter first (§6).** Most "what should I do here" answers are already in
   `/spec` + conformance + the component design. Only a genuine gap or fork
   earns a query.
2. **Ask and stop.** Post a `question` mentioning **only** the target's leader
   (Spec leader / Architect / Steward), set status `blocked-on-<target>`, and
   stop. Resume on notification — never poll.
3. **Bias to staying on-task.** Your team's default is to *wait out* a short
   block, preserving ring coherence; your leader reorders to an independent
   ready task only when the block is genuinely long.
4. **Front-desk on the answering side.** The target's leader triages to protect
   its own ring's focus — answers trivial/known questions itself, batches
   non-urgent ones, interrupts its active agent only for true blockers.
5. **Outcomes:** a quick interpretive answer; a **durable artifact edit** (a
   `/spec` clarification + conformance test, or a component-design note) so the
   next team never asks again; or, for a real fork, a **Decision**. Every query
   should leave the shared artifacts better — the query rate is a health gauge,
   and it should decay over time.

## 12. Resource discipline (shared 8-core / 16 GB laptop)

Build parallelism multiplies with agent parallelism; the dev box is small.
Violating this OOMs the machine and stalls everyone. Full rationale +
configuration: `../docs/ops/compute-budget.md`.

- **Build and test only through `scripts/ken-cargo`** — never raw `cargo build`/
  `cargo test`. It holds a machine-wide lock (`KEN_BUILD_SLOTS`, default 1) so
  only one build runs at a time across all agents. Bypassing it is the fastest
  way to swap-death the box.
- ** Scope to the touched crate** (`-p <crate>`, or `--test <name>` for one
  suite), **NEVER `--workspace` (operator hard rule).** Full-workspace builds,
  the `--locked` gate, the conformance suite, and any `--release`/LTO build run
  **in CI on GitHub**, not on the laptop — a local `--workspace` run is what OOMs
  the box and stalls everyone. Lean on CI green (the publisher path polls those
  exact checks before merging), don't reproduce it locally. **Every local agent
  is responsible only for the affected areas** — implementer, QA, leader, enclave,
  Steward alike. A WP frame's "no-regression" / "workspace-green" acceptance
  criterion therefore means **green in CI**, *never* a local `cargo test
  --workspace`; authors write frame ACs that way and readers execute them that
  way. (Operator, 2026-07-13 — a kenfmt implementer burned ~1h on a local locked
  workspace run the frame wrongly mandated; the venue is CI, full stop.)
- **`source scripts/ken-env.sh`** at session start for the shared `sccache` +
  `CARGO_HOME`, so you don't recompile dependencies other agents already built.
- **Idle = paused.** A resident agent costs RAM even when not building. If your
  ring is blocked or waiting (including waiting on a CI run — ADR 0002),
  quiesce; don't hold the box hot.
- This is a *current-hardware* constraint, not a design value — it relaxes as
  hardware grows (the Steward/operator raises the caps; do not raise them
  unilaterally).

### 12a. NEVER `git stash` — the stash stack is SHARED across every worktree

**Binding on every seat, no exceptions** (Steward, 2026-07-22, after a live
near-miss).

`git stash` stores entries in `refs/stash` on the **shared repository**, not
per-worktree. The fleet runs **~70 agent worktrees over one clone**, so every
seat sees and mutates **one stack**. A bare `git stash pop` from *any* worktree
takes `stash@{0}` — **whichever agent parked something last**, which is almost
never you. Observed live: **12 entries from at least four different agents.**

**The near-miss.** A build implementer ran `git stash pop` mid-slice and nearly
consumed another team's parked diagnostic work. It was saved **only because the
apply hit a merge conflict** — git retains the entry on conflict rather than
dropping it. **On a clean apply it would have silently destroyed another
agent's work**, and the owner would have found an empty stack with no error, no
log, and no way to learn who took it. **This is the failure class no individual
seat can detect**, which is why it is fleet law and not a team retro item.

**Use one of these instead — all per-branch, so they cannot collide:**

- **Commit it.** A WP commit on your own `<role>/work` branch is the normal
  move, and is what the handoff gate expects anyway.
- **`git worktree add`** a scratch worktree for the experiment.
- If you genuinely must stash: **`git stash push -m "<role>: <what>"`**, and
  thereafter **only `git stash apply stash@{n}`** on an entry whose message you
  wrote yourself. **Never `pop`. Never a bare index.** Prefer committing.

** Do not reap the existing stack.** Those entries belong to other seats.

> Same shared-substrate family as the **single object store** (a commit that
> verifies locally may never have been pushed — §14) and the **shared `/tmp`**
> (at 99% full it silently dropped a git write). **Worktrees look isolated and
> are not** — before assuming any git state is yours alone, ask whether the
> underlying ref lives in the clone or in the worktree.

## 13. Liveness: keep the rings turning

Token rings stall — an agent finishes, forgets to hand off, and the ring goes
quiet. Treat stalls as the **default** failure mode, defended in depth by three
recurring watchdogs, each catching the layer below it failing:

- **Team leader → its own ring.** Enumerated patterns: handed-off-but-silent,
  merge-Decision-open-no-reviewer, blocked-without-a-blocker-mention,
  idle-with-ready-work.
- **Steward → the merge pipeline.** Branch-published-CI-pending-too-long,
  CI-green-but-Decision-unresolved, Decision-approved-but-CI-red,
  approved-and-green-but-unmerged.
- **Steward → the federation (the backstop).** A whole team idle, a *stalled
  leader*, a dropped cross-team query, a blocked dependency chain, no movement
  toward the active gate. The watcher-of-watchers — it catches a watchdog that
  itself stalled.

Rules for every layer:
- **Enumerate the stall patterns explicitly** in the watchdog prompt — a generic
  "check for activity" misses the nuance.
- **Diagnose before you restart.** Capture the stalled agent's state first; a
  blind restart no-ops a permission-prompt or rate-limit stall.
- **Distinguish waiting from stalling.** A team idle while its CI run is *in
  progress* is normal (ADR 0002), not a stall — leave it alone. Recover only
  when CI has *finished* and no one took the next step (open the merge Decision,
  vote it, fix red, merge).
- **Graduated recovery:** detect → mention the one blocked agent → re-mention
  next interval → escalate up the chain.
- **Escalation chain:** member → team leader → Steward → the operator. The buck
  stops at the operator (human): if the Steward goes quiet, the absence of its
  updates is the operator's signal. Watchdogs are the only schedulers (§1);
  everyone else is event-driven.
- **Arm your watchdog with the convo-channel `schedule_create` self-wake — NOT
  the convo `schedule_call`, and NOT a hand-rolled wake script** (operator
  2026-07-20; supersedes the earlier `CronCreate`-only guidance). `schedule_create`
  is the **one sanctioned, provider-agnostic** watchdog mechanism — it works
  identically on Claude-Code **and** terra/Codex seats, so the whole fleet
  converges on a single command. A scheduler (team leader, Steward) sets up its
  recurring pass at **session start, while its ring/pipeline has open work** — e.g.
  `schedule_create(interval_seconds=900, label="steward-watchdog",
  prompt="[watchdog tick] read get_recent_context, sweep the active panes, scan
  the enumerated stall patterns, mention only a blocked agent; if clear, do
  nothing")` (`interval_seconds` is the recurring "set_interval"; `cron="…"` for a
  5-field expression, `delay_seconds` for a one-shot). It **posts nothing to the
  space** — it delivers the prompt privately into your *own* session (a Claude-Code
  channel push when possible, else a guarded tmux `send-keys` that **skips a tick
  rather than overtyping a human's not-yet-submitted input**). On each fire you run
  your *own* direct `get_recent_context` / `get_space_status` read (private, not
  posted) and do the stall-pattern assessment + recovery above, **messaging the
  space only when there is an actual stall to nudge.** It returns a `schedule_id`;
  **`schedule_delete(schedule_id)` disarms it** ("clear_interval") and
  `schedule_list` shows the schedules you own. A leader may arm a **teammate's**
  pane by passing an explicit `target`.
  **Do NOT use the convo `schedule_call`** for a watchdog: it executes the read
  *on the backend* and posts the result back into the space as a **System event
  visible to every participant** — pure broadcast noise (and the
  `get_recent_context` variant reads its own prior fires and recursively nests
  them — an exponential self-feeding loop the Architect + runtime-leader caught).
  A watchdog is a *private* wake, not a public post; `schedule_create` is private,
  `schedule_call` is not. Likewise **do NOT** hand-roll a bash `while`-loop, the
  `Monitor` tool (git-refs only — blind to the pane-level stalls), or the interim
  `local/steward-watchdog-wake.sh` external tick script — that script was the
  terra-seat stopgap **before** `schedule_create` existed and is now superseded.
  **A scheduler that never arms its watchdog catches nothing** — the operator
  caught exactly this (a QA-approved WP left unmerged because the leader wasn't
  watching).
- **`schedule_create` schedules are process-local, which is mostly a feature —
  they cannot orphan across a restart — but they carry ONE regression you must
  defend against: they live only for the convo-channel MCP server process's
  lifetime and do NOT survive an MCP reconnect** (a package upgrade, a network
  blip, or a compaction that re-instantiates the client all drop them silently —
  and posting/notification can stay up while they're gone). So **re-arm on session
  start, after every compaction, AND after any convo-MCP reconnect**, and
  **reconcile with `schedule_list` at the top of each tick** — if the list is
  empty while your ring/WP is open, your backstop silently fell over; re-arm it.
  **`schedule_delete` it when your ring/WP closes.** (On a Claude-Code seat the
  host-level `CronCreate`/`CronDelete` remains available and *does* survive an MCP
  reconnect; it is a valid durable fallback for that seat, but default to
  `schedule_create` for fleet uniformity.) **If you still hold a convo
  `schedule_call` timer from the old guidance, `cancel_call` it and re-arm with
  `schedule_create`.**

## 14. Agents never touch GitHub; the publisher path is the gateway

**Only the publisher path has GitHub credentials.** Build/spec agents do
**local git only** in their worktrees (commit, rebase onto the already-fetched
`origin/main`) — no `gh`, no push, no fetch, no token, no PR. Under explicit
operator direction, the Steward runs the checked-in scripted publisher path
(`scripts/scripted-pr-automerge.sh`) with only these inputs: an exact approved
branch/SHA, public PR title, public PR body, and the docs-only flag. This keeps
one GitHub identity; it does not give teams GitHub access, does not make the
Steward a code author, and does not replace the mootup review/Decision record
(`../docs/program/04-git-and-integration.md`).

### 14a. THE ARCHITECT DOES NOT VOTE ON DOC-ONLY WPs

**Operator ruling, 2026-07-22:** *"architect does not need to rule on docs."*

**A WP whose diff is confined to `library/` merges on its QA approval plus the
diff-scope check.** No Architect vote. The Steward resolves the merge Decision
and publishes.

**The Architect's vote is still required** when a documentation change makes a
**normative claim about the language** (`spec/` is the sole authority —
`library/` is explanatory/derived), **or when its diff reaches outside
`library/` at all** — with only the named exceptions below.

**Steward duty:** when a track is nominally concurrent, check that its *review
and merge path* is disjoint too — not just its file paths. **Concurrency that
funnels into one reviewer is sequencing with extra steps.**

The publisher path pushes `wp/<ID>` branches to trigger CI, reads checks,
merges, fetches `main`, and mirrors GitHub state into mootup. If GitHub reports
that a separate review or branch-protection change is required, the script must
stop and route that fact; it must not pretend a same-identity PR review can
satisfy the gate.

- **Agents get no GitHub notifications and never poll GitHub.** Because GitHub
  is the publisher path's concern, every actionable signal reaches the fleet
  only as a **mootup message that mentions the actor whose move it is.** Act on
  the mention, not on a timer.
- **CI is the publisher path's to watch — never a worker's.** It reads check
  status for the branches it published (`gh pr checks` / the checks API) and
  posts the outcome: red → mention the implementer (team space) with the failing
  job; green → advance toward merge. The optional `ken-ci` bridge mirrors
  `check_suite` results automatically; until then the publisher caller posts
  them. After you hand a WP off, you **stop** and learn a red result from a
  mention.
- **Landing integrity: a merge isn't trusted until *verified on `main`* — and a
  multi-piece WP isn't landed until *every* piece is (promoted V1,
  near-miss).** A **squash-merge can silently drop pieces** of an assembly built
  from multiple cherry-picks: the K2c-s2 seam-3 erratum shipped its **kernel**
  fix in `ecbb279` but **dropped the spec (`da344a6`) + conformance (`f3ece75`)**
  pieces, leaving `16 §5.1` normatively **contradicting its own kernel** and the
  corpus guarding nothing — and it **survived the ship**, invisible in every
  "shipped" status/notification. Caught only by **grounding against the landed
  files**. So: (1) **don't trust a "shipped `<sha>`" notification or a status
  line** that a thing landed — for anything load-bearing, confirm it on `origin/
  main` (the files: `git grep`/`git show`). (2) **An approved N-piece erratum/WP
  is not "landed" until you verify each piece on `main`** (the Architect's
  3-piece-on-main gate) — the leader who assembles a multi-cherry-pick branch
  checks the post-merge `main` carries all of them. (3) **Authors ground
  the WP *base* against the landed corpus, not the notifications,** before
  building on it.
  **(4) PREVENTIVE — a multi-piece erratum is ONE branch, ONE Decision (promoted
  Σ-sort, the *2nd* recurrence).** The §5.1 drop recurred **immediately** on the
  Σ-sort 3-piece (`badc78d` shipped only the kernel `sort_sigma` split; spec `13`
  + the pi-sigma conformance were absent from `main`) — so points (1)–(3) are the
  *detective* control; this is the *preventive* one. **Root cause:** when one
  piece is a **crates-only kernel fix**, its diff-scope reads crates-only
  (Architect + CI, **no Spec**) and it merges **alone** — the spec + conformance
  pieces, sitting on *other* branches, are never in the merged tree. It isn't the
  squash dropping commits; the pieces were **never assembled onto the branch that
  merged**. **Fix:** assemble **all** N pieces (kernel + spec + conformance) onto
  a **single** `wp/<erratum>` branch *before* the merge Decision — the combined
  diff-scope then **touches `spec/`+`conformance/`**, correctly pulls a **Spec
  vote**, and all N commits ride **one squash** to `main` together. Never publish
  the kernel piece on its own crates-only branch while siblings wait. **The
  publisher caller confirms the Decision's branch carries every cited piece
  before merge** (validated on `s51-sigma-reland`: one branch, both
  `spec/`+`conformance/` pieces → the Decision correctly pulled a Spec vote →
  "§14 compliant").
  **(5) Single-branch is necessary but NOT sufficient — verify an assembled tip on
  TWO axes, against CURRENT `main`, right before the Decision (promoted X1-effects-
  elab; both enclave authors + the Architect converged on it).** One branch
  guarantees the pieces are *together in one diff*; it does **not** guarantee they
  are **complete** or that the **base is current**. Two faults nearly merged a wrong
  tree on X1-effects-elab: (a) the assembler took the author's *§6-body* commit but
  **not their branch tip**, dropping a follow-up (`a3b887e`) that fixed an
  **actively-wrong** stale pointer; (b) the re-fold sat on a **stale base** that, as
  `main` advanced, would have **reverted V2-build + the V3 frame**. So before the
  merge Decision, re-run (right then — *"rebased onto current main" is a perishable
  claim*): **content** — `git diff <author-full-tip>:<file> <assembled>:<file>`
  **EMPTY**, taking **all** the author's commits since merge-base (a dropped
  follow-up is invisible if you only diff the section you read); **base/scope** —
  `git diff --stat origin/main <assembled>` is **only** the WP's intended files and
  **the WP's deps are ancestors of the tip** (a dep that is not an ancestor is
  simply absent from the candidate — the WP builds on something it does not
  contain).

  A correct-content tip on a genuinely-intersecting stale base is as unmergeable
  as the reverse — the base axis is a distinct failure mode, but it is
  **intersection-gated**, not automatic.
  **Lane note:** the independent checker (conformance-validator) is *stronger
  verifying the assembler's tip against these gates than performing the rebase
  itself* — when grounding surfaces an assembly hazard, **flag it to the
  assembler**, don't reach past your lane into the git (where the X1-effects-elab
  drops happened).
  **(6) TEMPORAL — a fold/erratum that races an in-flight merge must HOLD the
  merge or be an erratum-on-current-`main` from the start (promoted Sec1; a
  *race*, not an assembly fault).** Points (1)–(5) assume the pieces sit on
  branches you control at Decision time; this one is about **timing**. On Sec1
  the Architect approved `61` with an N1/N2 honesty fold flagged "fold before
  build, not a merge-blocker." The author committed the fold declaring it
  "supersedes `b3e7989`," the coordinator had already rebased the **pre-fold**
  tip + posted merge_ready, and the publisher path squashed the pre-fold spec to
  `main` **9 seconds before** the fold landed — so the honesty chapter hit `main`
  carrying the exact §9 over-claim the fold fixed; netted only by verify-on-main,
  re-landed in minutes. **A "supersedes X" line interlocks nothing, and
  decision-time "hasn't merged yet" is perishable within seconds.** So: **author
  side** — never "fold + declare supersede" against a WP whose votes/merge are in
  flight; either mention the leader to **HOLD the merge** *before* committing
  the fold, or author it as a fresh erratum-on-current-`main`.
  **Coordinator side** — "not a merge blocker" ≠ "merge *before* it lands"; when
  a fold is in-flight and the merge is seconds away, **briefly HOLD** the merge
  so the chapter is correct at first landing (the coordinator can prevent the
  race the author cannot gate). The only reliable net remains **verify-on-main
  after**, never a declaration before.
- **Review is a mootup Decision — and a *soundness vote is a frontier-class
  responsibility* (promoted Sec1ct/B1 + operator).** The Architect/Spec read the
  diff from the shared local branch (`git diff origin/main...wp/<ID>`) and vote
  the merge Decision in mootup; there is no GitHub PR approval to mirror. **Two
  load-bearing reviewers, both Opus-tier:** the **Architect** (external
  soundness/design, always) and the **Spec** vote on `spec/`+`conformance/`
  paths — cast by the **frontier-class (Opus) member of team Spec**, currently
  the **conformance-validator** (the independent checker by role; spec-author
  authors, so cannot self-review). The **DeepSeek coordinator (spec-leader, a
  build leader) assembles the Decision but does NOT cast the soundness
  vote** — soundness judgment needs the strongest model (MODELS.md tiering, made
  explicit for review routing).
- **The publisher path merges only on a *resolved* Decision, verified fresh —
  never on a `merge_ready` post's prose (promoted Sec1ct breach; fixed +
  validated 2/2).** A `merge_ready` is a *request*; the **resolved Decision with
  recorded approvals** is the authorization. Before `gh pr merge`, the publisher
  caller re-reads the Decision and confirms `status: resolved` (not `proposed`)
  with the Architect's (and Spec's, on spec paths) votes in — it never infers
  approval from a reviewer *named in prose* (the Sec1ct merge skipped the gate
  exactly this way: "`(Architect + Spec)`" read as approval while the Architect
  never voted). Symmetrically, whoever posts `merge_ready` states
  `Decision: dec_XXX — status: resolved` (or `proposed — awaiting <reviewer>`)
  and fires **real @mentions** to reviewers' actor_ids (§2 live-participant),
  not prose names.
- **The publisher caller mirrors each GitHub state change into mootup mentioning
  whoever moves next** — CI red → the implementer; merged → Steward. A GitHub
  state change nobody mirrors is a silent stall.
- The full event→message map (what, where, mentioning whom, posted by whom) is
  in `../docs/program/04-git-and-integration.md §5`.

## 15. Context compaction is the Steward's (teams) or self (singletons)

Token efficiency: an agent should start each work package with a clean, minimal
context. Who triggers a compaction is fixed (operator, 2026-06-29):

- **Teams are compacted by the Steward**, not by their own leader. The Steward
  `moot compact`s the **whole team** (leader + implementer + QA, or spec-leader +
  spec-author + conformance-validator) **before delivering a WP** to the leader.
  Leaders never `moot compact` anyone — `request_context_reset` is self-only, so
  only the Steward can compact another agent (`moot compact`), and it does so for
  teams alone.
- **Gated by retros.** The Steward compacts a team **only after** its prior WP's
  retros are posted (compaction would otherwise summarize the retro away), and
  delivers the next WP **only after** compacting. So a team's WP boundary is:
  done → leader calls for retros in-thread → members post → leader signals the
  Steward "retros in" → Steward reviews → Steward compacts → next WP.
- **Singletons self-compact, EXCEPT the Adversary.** Agents with no team/leader
  — **Steward, Architect, Librarian, Research** — self-compact at their own task
  boundaries (Architect after a review, Librarian after a pass, Steward after a
  directing cycle) via
  the `tmux send-keys -t moot-<role> -l '/compact'` path (two-step: `/compact`,
  ~2s, then a **separate** `Enter`). To auto-continue afterward — a self-compact
  otherwise leaves the seat idle at `❯` with nothing to re-invoke it — launch
  the **detached resume watcher** `scripts/postcompact-resume.sh moot-<role>`
  (`nohup … & disown`) **before** sending `/compact`: it outlives the turn and
  the compaction, waits for the `Compacting…` window to appear and clear, then
  sends `resume`. Do **not** instead type `resume` right after `/compact` and
  rely on host buffering — that races the still-active turn and can fire the
  resume *before* compaction (the reason the watcher exists). Do **not** use
  `request_context_reset` — it is broken in this harness (it looks for a
  nonexistent `convo-<role>` session and its error message *names* `convo-<role>`,
  which is the bug, not a target to retry). Full mechanics:
  `playbooks/federation/steward.md` (self-compact).
- **The Adversary is compacted by the Steward, at the merge notification.**
  Operator, 2026-08-17: *"There is nothing that compacts adversary and the
  adversary does not self-compact."* This clause used to list it with the
  singletons above, and that assignment produced **no compaction at all** — the
  seat had no work boundary anyone else could see, because it is event-driven and
  an idle event-driven seat drops out of every active-agent enumeration. Its
  compaction is now a numbered step the Steward runs: `merge-procedure.md` **M8a**,
  immediately before the M8b code-merge notification, with the pane rouse after
  it (a mention does not wake a compacted no-poll seat). **The pairing is the
  rule: never notify it without offering it a compaction first.**
- **Never mid-reasoning.** Compact only at a clean boundary; it summarizes away
  in-flight work.
- **Start new work from current `origin/main` (operator, 2026-06-29).** A WP
  branch is born from the **fetched** ref — leaders cut `wp/<ID>` with
  `git branch wp/<ID>-<slug> origin/main`, and every member `git rebase
  origin/main` before working. Never build on stale local `main` or a stale
  worktree (the §1 / 04-git worktree-mismatch trap). New work = latest `main`.
- **On resume after a compaction, ground-truth your state before trusting the
  summary.** A compaction can summarize away the fact that you *finished* — so
  re-orient from reality, not the lossy summary: `orientation()` **plus**
  `git reflog -10`, `git status`, `git branch -vv`, **plus check unread
  mentions** (`orientation`'s unread count / `get_mentions`). Your pre-compact
  self's commits and checkouts are in the reflog; check there before concluding
  you (or a teammate) are "stalled" or re-doing delivered work. **Notification
  delivery is best-effort** — a mention that landed while your session was
  bouncing (e.g. a fleet restart) is recorded but may never have woken you, so a
  resume is when you catch it. (F4 + K1, operator-observed — promoted here
  because the Steward-compacts-every-WP rule makes post-compact resume a constant
  for every team member.)
